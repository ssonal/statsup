Nov 20, 2014, 5:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Hiring decisions are the professors'
Nov 20, 2014, 5:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The approach should be made through an email or through another contact only to ensure that they're available to talk to you

That'll have to be at least slightly related to what I want to work in. I either need a multidisciplinary project like our current one or need to work in the CSA department
Nov 20, 2014, 5:54 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I need the CSA thing as a safety net if MS doesn't work out this year. Have to fall back on something. I can't go work somewhere.

Dec 31, 2014, 2:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what those papers are based on
Dec 31, 2014, 2:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I asked him to send me an email which I can modify and forward to IISc but he hasn't. Says he's out with his grandfather at the hospital.

Jan 1, 1:26 AM - Mojo: Haha yeah. Time slowed down for him i guess.
Jan 1, 1:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not sure if he's asking us to come up with the problem statement or whether he wants us to revise

Jan 7, 7:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Get whoever you can to do it
Jan 7, 7:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hate this sort of shit. It's no way to decide whether or not something is actually worthwhile :/
Jan 7, 7:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like a contestant on a reality TV show!
Jan 7, 7:07 PM - Mojo: Yeah. That's what I was talking to Aashish about. Doesn't make sense
Jan 7, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the scene tomorow?
Jan 8, 5:52 AM - Mojo: Aashish isn't coming. Not sure about Adi
Jan 8, 7:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Will you be able to make it?
Jan 8, 7:45 AM - Mojo: You're busy?
Jan 8, 7:45 AM - Mojo: Are you *

Jan 8, 7:47 AM - Mojo: I'll call him
Jan 8, 7:49 AM - Mojo: Not answering

Jan 9, 7:02 PM - Mojo: How many did you solve? Easy?
Jan 9, 7:02 PM - Mojo: Yeah. The game theory guy is bad.

Jan 18, 10:13 PM - Mojo: Hmmm ok
Jan 18, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's the first working day. 10 doesn't make sense. It's very likely that he'll be in class.
Jan 18, 10:24 PM - Mojo: Then after 11. Might not be there if he has class at 8
Jan 18, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Our department doesn't open till 9

Jan 22, 9:12 PM - Mojo: Cant mess up like last time

Jan 22, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And have you managed to make aashish do anything at all?
Jan 22, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's pissing me off

Jan 22, 9:13 PM - Mojo: I haven't said anything
Jan 22, 9:14 PM - Mojo: Ask him to read up and search
Jan 22, 9:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I messaged him yesterday, asked him to work. In the morning, asked him to work. in the evening I asked what he's done, he said 'nothing'.
Jan 22, 9:17 PM - Mojo: 🙈
Jan 22, 9:17 PM - Mojo: Don't know what to do then

Jan 26, 11:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Should I include the point about wanting to make improvements?
Jan 26, 11:52 AM - Mojo: Nope. We'll include it in the final report if we can do it.
Jan 26, 1:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aashish says the code he found is only for classical networks, not for WSN
Jan 26, 1:45 PM - Mojo: Ohh
Jan 26, 4:58 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Jan 26, 4:58 PM - Mojo: Helping a friend of mine with some survey.

Jan 26, 4:59 PM - Mojo: Its a startup called Medvizr.
Jan 26, 5:00 PM - Mojo: They are trying to create an online portal for doctors. Like a zomato for doctors.
Jan 26, 5:00 PM - Mojo: The company needs reviews. They already have 12k. They want more before bootstrapping.
Jan 26, 5:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What does the questionnaire mean?
Jan 26, 5:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay:

Jan 26, 5:57 PM - Mojo: Cool.
Jan 27, 9:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's up Bob?
Jan 27, 9:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was taking a bath.
Jan 27, 9:39 PM - Mojo: Wanted to know about the synopsis.
Jan 27, 9:40 PM - Mojo: Spoke to Aashish
Jan 27, 9:40 PM - Mojo: Said he'll find out when he goes to college on Thursday
Jan 27, 9:41 PM - Mojo: Did you figure out how the algorithms work?
Jan 27, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, worked on Finalytics. 
What was the problem with them you said?
Jan 27, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why didn't you include those in the email?
Jan 27, 10:34 PM - Mojo: Still haven't finished that?
Jan 27, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It goes on Bob. Lots of development still to be done. I'm going at it alone so it's taking for beer.
Jan 27, 10:34 PM - Mojo: Weren't problems. We just had to reduce the number of rounds.
Jan 27, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Forever
Jan 27, 10:35 PM - Mojo: It was 100. Reduced it to 5.
Jan 27, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll drop this on Drive and send him a link?
Jan 27, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He can do whatever he wants with it.
Jan 27, 10:38 PM - Mojo: Hmmm.
Jan 27, 10:39 PM - Mojo: rmax to be reduced. Preferably below ten.
Jan 27, 10:39 PM - Mojo: Add this and send it.
Jan 27, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's a scientist. Let's see if he can figure it out.
Jan 27, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm curious to see if this guy knows anything at all.
Jan 27, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't seem like it.
Jan 27, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think this is his area of expertise.
Jan 27, 10:40 PM - Mojo: Would love to do that.
Jan 27, 10:41 PM - Mojo: Don't have much time though
Jan 27, 10:41 PM - Mojo: He'll surely think the code is wrong.
Jan 27, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I sense that this is going to be the same as last sem. We'll end up doing all the work.
Jan 27, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Might as well have some fun while we're at it.
Jan 27, 10:45 PM - Mojo: Lol. Why not.
Jan 27, 10:45 PM - Mojo: Can't figure out why he is horny for Matlab though.
Jan 27, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm serious about writing some papers this sem though. That's why I'm pushing for TeX and stuff.
Jan 27, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Getting everyone set up.
Jan 27, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's dead simple to use, like any other markup language - html and so on. 
And it's made for typesetting so the documents are perfect.
Jan 27, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not like what our final report looked like
Jan 27, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently once people figure TeX out, they don't go back to anything else.
Jan 27, 10:51 PM - Mojo: Cool. I'll download it then.
Jan 27, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll send you a push with resources.
Jan 27, 10:52 PM - Mojo: Aashish sent it.
Jan 27, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ravi Tandon's work isn't really to do with routing, it's to do with clustering.

Jan 27, 11:09 PM - Mojo: Programs i simulated was clustering
Jan 27, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know

Jan 29, 9:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Figured out TeX?
Jan 29, 9:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Installations done?
Jan 29, 9:46 PM - Mojo: Downloading
Jan 29, 9:46 PM - Mojo: Look at the last paper I pushed?
Jan 29, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 15 implementations!
Jan 29, 10:02 PM - Mojo: Uuussshhhuuuuu
Jan 29, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Look at the pdf in that folder.
Jan 29, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what it'll finally look like.
Jan 29, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Still have to add header &  footer
Jan 29, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Going to sleep now. I'll be up at 4:30 to work.
Jan 29, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Check and see if aashish is up. Get him to write some stuff up
Jan 29, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll proof it in the morning and modify
Jan 29, 11:13 PM - Mojo: Look into hardware implementation
Jan 29, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I saw the videos and some of the papers
Jan 29, 11:13 PM - Mojo: We could use ccontikki
Jan 29, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Looks possible.
Jan 29, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Contiki aashish found last week
Jan 29, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Noo
Jan 29, 11:14 PM - Mojo: Why?
Jan 30, 6:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Call me once you're up
Jan 30, 6:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Need you to bring the laptop.
Feb 2, 2:16 PM - Mojo: Ask Aashish to talk to Mekali
Feb 2, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: About?
Feb 2, 2:17 PM - Mojo: Why did g heReject our group
Feb 2, 2:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you, I didn't submit our email ids
Feb 2, 2:17 PM - Mojo: Ohh yeah. Forgot.
Feb 2, 2:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Check Dropbox.
Feb 2, 2:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: New report.
Feb 2, 5:28 PM - Mojo: 👍
Feb 2, 5:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Check the new rubrics and see if it fits.
Feb 2, 5:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: KPL is going to review. It's going to be painful.
Feb 2, 6:46 PM - Mojo: Who said?
Feb 2, 7:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's put it up.
Feb 2, 7:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sudheendra and her.
Feb 2, 8:09 PM - Mojo: Saw it now. Damm
Feb 2, 9:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You went through the report?
Feb 2, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So it's right, what we've done.
Feb 2, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll work on formating. See if you find informative content in the and let me know?
Feb 2, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, hardware implementation won't work for us.
Feb 2, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The issue of clustering comes about when you have over 10000 nodes or so
Feb 2, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Anything fewer and the problem isn't bad at all. That's why those simulations use those sort of numbers
Feb 2, 11:13 PM - Mojo: We can't create some sort of prototype ?
Feb 2, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: To show it using hardware you need those numbers I think
Feb 2, 11:13 PM - Mojo: Sure someone must have done it. Anyway it's a future work. Don't have to bother I think
Feb 2, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If not you can't demonstrate how it's more energy efficient than some other process
Feb 2, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like sorting 10 numbers and sorting 10,000
Feb 2, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only when the problem scales you feel the pinch
Feb 2, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Simulation should be good enough. Ours is an algorithmic approach anyway. If we show something conclusive in the simulation, then it should be enough
Feb 2, 11:16 PM - Mojo: I'll find a few papers for Lit survey
Feb 2, 11:16 PM - Mojo: Yeah. Should be enough.
Feb 2, 11:16 PM - Mojo: Speak to Aashish?
Feb 2, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Spoke to him.
Feb 2, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He was going to sleep. He's leaving home at 5am apparently. Off to some relative's house for a function.
Feb 2, 11:27 PM - Mojo: Okay.
Feb 2, 11:27 PM - Mojo: For the time being let's just use that literature survey I sent you.
Feb 2, 11:28 PM - Mojo: If I find any better papers tomorrow we'll add it
Feb 2, 11:29 PM - Mojo: Survey, routing protocols, energy and security concerns
Feb 2, 11:29 PM - Mojo: We could add a few more under routing
Feb 2, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Really good find this. How'd you get it?
Feb 2, 11:34 PM - Mojo: Searched for Literature survey format for IEEE projects
Feb 2, 11:35 PM - Mojo: It's got a nice flow which is good
Feb 3, 1:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Going through the literature review, I realized that it cannot be all about clustering and clustering surveys.
Feb 3, 1:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll be asked how we're doing anything new or what the guarantee that we're not ripping off these papers is.
Feb 3, 1:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Let's make the review more general about the issues in these networks on a broad scale including positioning, localization and other stuff like that.
Feb 3, 1:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Then we can finally describe our problem and propose a solution.
Feb 3, 8:38 AM - Mojo: Hmm okay. We could do that.
Feb 3, 8:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Almost done making my changes.
Feb 3, 8:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: When are you leaving?
Feb 3, 8:42 AM - Mojo: When are you coming?
Feb 3, 8:43 AM - Mojo: Laptop?
Feb 3, 8:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Get it if you can. We can both work then.
Feb 3, 8:43 AM - Mojo: Okay.Time?
Feb 3, 8:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I can leave now
Feb 3, 8:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You?
Feb 3, 8:45 AM - Mojo: Leave in half  an hour
Feb 3, 8:46 AM - Mojo: Is Aashish coming?
Feb 3, 8:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No. He's not in town or something
Feb 3, 8:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll be there by 10?
Feb 3, 8:48 AM - Mojo: around10 15
Feb 3, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Uploaded the new files.
Feb 3, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Get aashish to work on it.
Feb 3, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm beat. Need to lie down.
Feb 3, 10:43 PM - Mojo: He's sleeping
Feb 3, 10:44 PM - Mojo: I'm going to sleep now.
Feb 4, 12:41 PM - Mojo: You'll send Gowranga a mail?
Feb 4, 6:24 PM - Mojo: Mail gowranga?
Feb 4, 7:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what to say to that idiot :/
Feb 5, 7:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Bob. Sudhindra is guiding a project on WSN
Feb 5, 9:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've also added a ppt on Dropbox.
Feb 5, 9:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's to do with routing.
Feb 5, 10:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How the hell can P30 have the same guide and reviewer?
Feb 5, 10:52 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Bob, did you see bhaktha's email?
Feb 5, 11:46 AM - Mojo: Yeah
Feb 5, 11:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can we change the first two pages?
Feb 5, 11:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Or let it go?
Feb 5, 11:47 AM - Mojo: Change it
Feb 5, 11:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I mean, he's printed them out already.
Feb 5, 11:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can they be replaced?
Feb 5, 11:47 AM - Mojo: Yes
Feb 5, 11:48 AM - Mojo: Call if you can
Feb 5, 11:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No balance
Feb 5, 11:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Have to recharge
Feb 5, 11:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll talk in college?
Feb 5, 11:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll leave now
Feb 5, 11:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Get your laptop
Feb 9, 8:24 AM - Mojo: How'd it go?
Feb 9, 9:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Messed up.
Feb 9, 9:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Finished third.
Feb 9, 9:29 AM - Mojo: Ah dam. Close?
Feb 9, 9:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It was close, but the guy kept putting more and more random science shit in the quiz.
Feb 9, 9:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Finished third by 10
Feb 9, 9:42 AM - Mojo: Oh. Sucks.
Feb 9, 9:42 AM - Mojo: You back?
Feb 9, 9:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yep
Feb 9, 11:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Saw the links I sent?
Feb 9, 11:24 AM - Mojo: Residual energy? Yes
Feb 9, 11:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's definitely something there. Screw what they think in college.
Feb 9, 11:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Need to figure the platform for simulation out though.
Feb 9, 11:27 AM - Mojo: Aashish is looking into it
Feb 9, 11:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Reply to bhaktha asking to meet this week.
Feb 9, 11:52 AM - Mojo: Done
Feb 9, 7:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Read the game theory paper?
Feb 9, 7:14 PM - Mojo: Nope. Outside
Feb 10, 1:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Didn't email bhaktha?
Feb 10, 1:46 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Feb 10, 1:46 PM - Mojo: Forgot to attach you
Feb 11, 12:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Got the message from sujith?
Feb 11, 1:30 PM - Mojo: Spoke to him?
Feb 11, 2:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. He said it's fine.
Feb 11, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Updated Dropbox.
Feb 11, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also look at the most recent push. Masters Thesis.
Feb 11, 8:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He explains how he used contiki.
Feb 11, 9:10 PM - Mojo: I'll check now
Feb 12, 10:23 PM - Mojo: Coming to college tomorrow?
Feb 12, 10:24 PM - Mojo: Jayanti isn't coming
Feb 12, 10:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can we get work done?
Feb 12, 10:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My mom will throw me out of the house.
Feb 12, 10:40 PM - Mojo: Hmm ok
Feb 12, 10:40 PM - Mojo: What time.?
Feb 12, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Morning also no class?
Feb 12, 10:41 PM - Mojo: Doubt they'll attend
Feb 12, 10:43 PM - Mojo: Have to go out in the evening.have to leave at 3 30
Feb 13, 8:29 AM - Mojo: Coming ?
Feb 13, 9:22 PM - Mojo: Going?
Feb 13, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Didn't happen
Feb 13, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sucks
Feb 13, 9:22 PM - Mojo: Dam.
Feb 13, 9:23 PM - Mojo: Are you coming to college ? Not worth it at all.
Feb 13, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But then sheena will take us to hoppipola :P
Feb 13, 9:23 PM - Mojo: Sure😝
Feb 13, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I might. Don't have attendance :/
Feb 13, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll be missing lots more weekends
Feb 13, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Crucible, surathkal, Bhubaneswar maybe
Feb 13, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Trichy maybe
Feb 13, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hate that we got screwed over with siddapaji
Feb 13, 9:25 PM - Mojo: Yeah. Any other teacher and we needn't have bothered
Feb 15, 9:01 PM - Mojo: Do you have the ppt?
Feb 15, 9:01 PM - Mojo: Mekali wants ppt and the synopsis
Feb 15, 9:01 PM - Mojo: I'll mail the synopsis to you
Feb 15, 9:02 PM - Mojo: Mail it to him along with the ppt
Feb 15, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yep. He called?
Feb 15, 10:03 PM - Mojo: Aashish texted me saying he wants it
Feb 15, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Let him send?
Feb 15, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've put the ppt on Dropbox
Feb 15, 10:04 PM - Mojo: Doesn't have the modified report
Feb 15, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Put it on Dropbox
Feb 15, 10:05 PM - Mojo: Could you send it? He is sleeping I think
Feb 16, 9:10 AM - Mojo: Going to college?
Feb 16, 10:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yep
Feb 16, 4:51 PM - Mojo: Make any progress?
Feb 16, 4:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Actually found it really hard to figure out contiki
Feb 16, 4:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: People have used it but no one will say how
Feb 16, 4:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Exploring ns3
Feb 16, 4:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think it's more promising.
Feb 16, 4:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've taken a copy of the software. Will look into it.
Feb 17, 10:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Saw the push. For the clustering paper he's used Matlab sum.
Feb 17, 10:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Sim
Feb 17, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The text is really nice
Feb 17, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Spoke to aashish, he'll come tomorrow morn
Feb 17, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We need laptops to get any work done. Everyone comes and uses the desktop.
Feb 17, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We have access to Vara's wifi.
Feb 17, 10:57 PM - Mojo: Cool
Feb 18, 8:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: On your way I hope?
Feb 18, 8:47 AM - Mojo: Leaving in fifteen
Feb 18, 8:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm on my way already! Couldn't tell me sooner? Aashish also isn't coming till 10:30
Feb 18, 9:00 AM - Mojo: I was sleeping bob.
Feb 18, 9:00 AM - Mojo: I'll be there as soon as possible
Feb 18, 10:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Come to the lab
Feb 18, 10:29 PM - Mojo: We should implement our project on the moon😂😂
Feb 18, 10:29 PM - Mojo: Perfect place
Feb 18, 10:30 PM - Mojo: Think it's possible?
Feb 18, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: To what end though?
Feb 18, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's nothing to be gained from this being on the moon
Feb 18, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Surveillance?
Feb 18, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: To indicate refugees
Feb 18, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or monitor wildlife sanctuaries, poachers and stuff
Feb 18, 10:47 PM - Mojo: Check the last push
Feb 18, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I saw. Didn't really understand how the network will probe for water
Feb 18, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who's distributing the network?
Feb 18, 10:48 PM - Mojo: I couldn't get the full paper. I've pushed a link
Feb 18, 10:49 PM - Mojo: I don't know how but it seems exciting
Feb 18, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It is, but no one's willing to share how the simulation works!
Feb 18, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what is upsetting me
Feb 18, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We need to talk to a scientist who's done this.
Feb 18, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not some guy who they've put away in a lab that no one can find.
Feb 18, 10:50 PM - Mojo: Bhaktha has done it?
Feb 18, 10:50 PM - Mojo: Lol
Feb 18, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think bhaktha has, choks and all definitely have.
Feb 18, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Vara would've recognised bhaktha's name if he was in this field
Feb 18, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bhaktha is more traditional networking I think
Feb 18, 10:51 PM - Mojo: We'll talk to bhaktha about this and see what he thinks
Feb 18, 10:51 PM - Mojo: I really want to do this
Feb 18, 10:51 PM - Mojo: Perfect scenario for our network.
Feb 18, 10:52 PM - Mojo: Energy saving is a must in this scenario.
Feb 18, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There will be all sorts of irrelevant questions :/ How do you simulate the moon environment?
Feb 18, 10:52 PM - Mojo: We'll look into it
Feb 18, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay
Feb 19, 12:57 PM - Mojo: How you coming?
Feb 19, 12:57 PM - Mojo: I could pick you up near majestic
Feb 19, 8:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What happened today Bob?
Feb 19, 10:54 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Feb 19, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Awesome.
Feb 19, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Search and see if you can find some sort of starter code?
Feb 19, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's difficult, when I think about it.
Feb 19, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Coz the line is in some corner.
Feb 19, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not directly under the car like we're used to.
Feb 19, 10:56 PM - Mojo: Yeah.
Feb 19, 10:58 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Feb 19, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nice
Feb 19, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Get me a copy of this Matlab version
Feb 20, 12:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The links are good and the algorithm is nice, but the problem here is that a WSN isn't being used.
Feb 20, 12:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He's taking points in a plane and grouping them.
Feb 20, 12:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We have to at the very least, simulate the WSN
Feb 20, 6:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Optimizing Traffic Light of an Intersection by using Game Theory | Hamidreza Navidi - Academia.edu - https://www.academia.edu/10950081/Optimizing_Traffic_Light_of_an_Intersection_by_using_Game_Theory
Feb 20, 6:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: More fascinating stuff from the world of game theory.
Feb 20, 10:02 PM - Mojo: Good stuff. Only issue with game theory is inc complexity
Feb 20, 10:02 PM - Mojo: As the number of players increase
Feb 20, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Coming tomorrow?
Feb 20, 10:42 PM - Mojo: Should we? Don't feel like it
Feb 20, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't miss attendance.. I'll come
Feb 20, 10:49 PM - Mojo: Might not come.
Feb 20, 10:49 PM - Mojo: We just waste time
Feb 20, 10:51 PM - Mojo: I'll study tomorrow. Going out on Sunday
Feb 21, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She can run? :P
Feb 21, 8:52 PM - Mojo: Make it 30
Feb 21, 8:52 PM - Mojo: She might cut 40
Feb 21, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can she keep it up for 5?
Feb 21, 8:52 PM - Mojo: Might.
Feb 21, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's about stamina.
Feb 21, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't wake up one day and decide you'll run 5km
Feb 21, 8:53 PM - Mojo: She runs 2k everyday I think
Feb 21, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She doesn't
Feb 21, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Find out?
Feb 21, 8:54 PM - Mojo: You know you won't get that much from her
Feb 21, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't matter. It's about the winning :p
Feb 21, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ask if she can run so much
Feb 22, 9:56 PM - Mojo: Studied?
Feb 22, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Trying
Feb 22, 10:05 PM - Mojo: Hmm
Feb 22, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You?
Feb 22, 10:26 PM - Mojo: Same
Feb 22, 10:26 PM - Mojo: Annoying
Feb 22, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like he's going to kill us in this paper
Feb 22, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The language, the dates, the numbers, nothing is easy to remember
Feb 23, 7:46 PM - Mojo: This subject send worse
Feb 23, 7:47 PM - Mojo: Seems*
Feb 23, 7:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I haven't opened yet
Feb 23, 7:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Read some articles online, that's all
Feb 23, 7:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think that's our best bet. The presentation of content online trumps any text.
Feb 23, 7:47 PM - Mojo: Articles about?
Feb 23, 7:47 PM - Mojo: Agile and Scrum?
Feb 23, 7:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All the headings that I could remember
Feb 23, 7:50 PM - Mojo: Hmm okay. I'll look into it
Mar 1, 7:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bob, take a break from that other work you're doing till the project gets on track?
Mar 1, 7:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't afford to screw it up.
Mar 1, 7:27 PM - Mojo: Not much  work next week anyway
Mar 1, 7:29 PM - Mojo: Call when you're free.
Mar 2, 9:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What'd sangeetha get done today?
Mar 2, 10:24 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Mar 2, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's her problem? :/
Mar 2, 10:50 PM - Mojo: I'm starting to get a little scared
Mar 2, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Me too
Mar 2, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Let's just go to college and see what can be done? Or at least work on freescale.
Mar 2, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I set Matlab up
Mar 2, 11:30 PM - Mojo: When?
Mar 3, 12:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Tomorrow? Or the day after?
Mar 3, 8:20 AM - Mojo: Tomorrow then
Mar 4, 8:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: College?
Mar 4, 8:10 AM - Mojo: Doesn't Aashish have sea gate?
Mar 4, 8:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Tomorrow.
Mar 4, 9:03 AM - Mojo: Is he coming?
Mar 4, 9:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He didn't pick up
Mar 4, 9:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've left messages
Mar 4, 9:03 AM - Mojo: OK. 10 15 then
Mar 4, 9:04 AM - Mojo: Laptop?
Mar 4, 9:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Bring. I'll get mine too.
Mar 4, 9:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We need his though. He has code warrior and stuff all set up
Mar 4, 9:05 AM - Mojo: We'll work on our project till he comes.
Mar 4, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hey bob
Mar 4, 10:24 PM - Mojo: Lol aanch
Mar 4, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why do you think it's her?
Mar 4, 10:25 PM - Mojo: Cause you've texted Hey bob!
Mar 4, 10:25 PM - Mojo: Never*
Mar 4, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's my new style
Mar 4, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bob
Mar 4, 10:26 PM - Mojo: Haha sure
Mar 4, 10:26 PM - Mojo: Good luck for the quiz
Mar 4, 10:27 PM - Mojo: Have fun
Mar 6, 10:29 PM - Mojo: Sent it
Mar 6, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, I'll read through
Mar 6, 11:02 PM - Mojo: Read the A section group.😂😂😂😂
Mar 6, 11:02 PM - Mojo: Epic stufg
Mar 6, 11:03 PM - Mojo: Stuff "
Mar 7, 7:34 AM - Mojo: Laptop bob
Mar 7, 7:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll get

Mar 8, 4:08 PM - Mojo: Check if you have my pen drive?
Mar 8, 5:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No Bob. You didn't even take it out on Saturday.
Mar 8, 8:43 PM - Mojo: Found it
Mar 8, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the scene tomorrow?
Mar 8, 9:07 PM - Mojo: Can't make it tomorrow. I'll come on Tuesday.
Mar 8, 9:07 PM - Mojo: Read through qualnet manual?
Mar 8, 9:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We have review on Thursday
Mar 8, 9:08 PM - Mojo: Yeah? He sent a mail?
Mar 8, 9:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They've a meeting on 10th, so review is tentatively scheduled for 12th

Mar 8, 9:15 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Mar 8, 9:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What else?
Mar 8, 9:21 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Mar 12, 10:28 PM - Mojo: Look at it
Mar 12, 10:28 PM - Mojo: ?
Mar 12, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We have something on all five algorithms?
Mar 12, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Common comparison parameters?
Mar 12, 10:30 PM - Mojo: We'll have to study about that
Mar 12, 10:30 PM - Mojo: Leach is all we can talk about now
Mar 12, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then we should try and avoid mentioning it
Mar 12, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Next week, we need to say that the algorithm work is done/nearing completion
Mar 12, 10:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Preferably, we need to create a comparison table to show which algorithm helps you gain where
Mar 12, 10:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And finally think of a story for next week.
Mar 12, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Change the project report folder. You have the one where we changed title and stuff.
Mar 12, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Replace it on Dropbox.
Mar 12, 10:41 PM - Mojo: Farmer suicide
Mar 12, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Serious face. Tv9 style.
Mar 12, 10:43 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Mar 12, 10:43 PM - Mojo: That's the face of our project
Mar 12, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hahaha 

Table for the presentation.
Mar 12, 10:52 PM - Mojo: Huh?
Mar 12, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The table you sent can be used for presentation
Mar 12, 10:53 PM - Mojo: Yeah
Mar 12, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just do a search for ns3 and see if we can use that instead?
Mar 12, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ns2, I'm having trouble with.
Mar 12, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I need to sleep. Just check about this and let me know.
See you tomorrow
Mar 12, 11:15 PM - Mojo: Cool
Mar 13, 10:07 PM - Mojo: Going to college tomorrow?
Mar 13, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You?
Mar 13, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. I don't have anything ethnic
Mar 13, 10:38 PM - Mojo: Not going to college. I'll come if we're going somewhere
Mar 15, 10:39 PM - Mojo: College tomorrow or on Tuesday?
Mar 16, 7:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We need to submit report
Mar 16, 7:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The throat infection turned into ear ache. So messed up. I've not had that complication for as long as I can remember
Mar 16, 8:52 AM - Mojo: Crap
Mar 16, 10:07 AM - Mojo: Uploaded the ppt. Needs changes.
Mar 16, 5:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll see. Been sleeping. Had fever.
Mar 16, 5:58 PM - Mojo: Installed ns3?
Mar 16, 6:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No Bob. Same issues as I had the other day. Might be because of the Linux version.
Mar 16, 8:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Downloading a different Ubuntu version now. Let's see if that works.
Mar 16, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Saw gowranga's reply?
Mar 16, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We need to drive the point about how we've done a lot of work. Which means we need to know a lot of shit for the presentation.
Mar 16, 9:15 PM - Mojo: Yeah
Mar 16, 9:15 PM - Mojo: We'll do it tomorrow
Mar 16, 9:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Presentation is tomorrow right?
Mar 16, 9:46 PM - Mojo: Think it's day after
Mar 16, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. Thought we were 31, we're 32.
Mar 17, 5:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Mar 17, 8:19 PM - Mojo: I installed ns2
Mar 17, 8:20 PM - Mojo: Did you yet running any code?
Mar 17, 8:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Trying to run a leach algorithm now
Mar 17, 8:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So apparently I have a very messed up throat. There are ulcers that are troubling lymph nodes, which in turn are causing ear pain
Mar 17, 8:45 PM - Mojo: Oh dam. How did you get ulcers?
Mar 17, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know :/
Mar 17, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's saying stress or heat or lack of sleep. Things like that cause it.
Mar 17, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's annoying. When I move my tongue it hurts.
Mar 17, 9:13 PM - Mojo: Hmm
Mar 17, 9:14 PM - Mojo: How long is it going to take to heal?
Mar 17, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Couple of days he said
Mar 17, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Still figuring this ns3 out. Not able to run stuff I've downloaded off the net.
Mar 17, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the status on ns2?
Mar 17, 10:05 PM - Mojo: Just installed it. Need to run codes tomorrow
Mar 17, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Left the comp on for about 4 hours for that shit to finish building.
Mar 17, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't know if it's because I'm running vm or its like that in general
Mar 17, 10:10 PM - Mojo: Think it's because of the VM
Mar 17, 10:10 PM - Mojo: Ns2 took forever
Mar 17, 11:11 PM - Mojo: Check uploaded ppt
Mar 17, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Did anyone today split it up like we have?
Mar 17, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Explaining on slides what each one's role is?
Mar 17, 11:17 PM - Mojo: Adi and Aanchal s group
Mar 17, 11:18 PM - Mojo: Is there a flow?
Mar 17, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Where do we address the application area?
Mar 17, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We haven't mentioned that.
Mar 17, 11:21 PM - Mojo: Precision agriculture no?
Mar 17, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. We need to justify the application also
Mar 17, 11:26 PM - Mojo: Motivation behind it ?
Mar 17, 11:27 PM - Mojo: Narendra Modi was an inspired idea
Mar 17, 11:27 PM - Mojo: 😝
Mar 17, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Otherwise he'll stare at you with one eye. And you know you're screwed.
Mar 20, 12:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Where're you?

Mar 24, 2:23 PM - Mojo: How long?
Mar 24, 9:49 PM - Mojo: What did you pick?
Mar 24, 9:50 PM - Mojo: Should we talk to the teachers and submit it tomorrow?
Mar 24, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Didn't pick yet. There's a lot of shit in IPR
Mar 24, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He gave me 29 last time. Reading that now.
Mar 24, 9:50 PM - Mojo: Yeah
Mar 24, 9:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll talk to teachers anyway tomorrow. Need to know what to put in abstract.
Mar 24, 9:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think we can make anything work, it's not that hard. Only thing is, how easy can we make our work without losing marks
Mar 24, 9:51 PM - Mojo: Hmm yeah. So we'll get back tomorrow and submit it
Mar 24, 10:20 PM - Mojo: Space tech for disas management. Section 1?

Mar 26, 8:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Similar concept. It drives you mad though!
Mar 26, 8:12 PM - Mojo: Look at it
Mar 26, 8:12 PM - Mojo: The best part is the offline play
Mar 26, 8:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. I sold my first set of businesses for angels already :P
Mar 26, 8:15 PM - Mojo: Tempted to do it
Mar 26, 8:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Build a couple trillion up first.

Apr 9, 9:23 AM - Sonal Saldanha: So we don't have much time.

Apr 10, 10:00 PM - Mojo: Trying to figure out how to install mannasim. Not a lot of support
Apr 10, 10:00 PM - Mojo: Cool.
Apr 10, 10:00 PM - Mojo: Ns2 is annoying as fuck
Apr 10, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why people stopped bothering :/
Apr 10, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We got screwed over by guides for both projects. He told us, pick whatever, submit whatever.
Apr 10, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So annoying!
Apr 10, 10:01 PM - Mojo: Yeah. I'll try something
Apr 10, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We told him wsn. He should've said something about it being hard to work on.
Apr 10, 10:17 PM - Mojo: Yeah.
Apr 10, 11:04 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Apr 10, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's no Fullstop Bob :P

Apr 10, 11:32 PM - Mojo: Could build  using make
Apr 10, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Make is done?
Apr 10, 11:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I searched for that error you encountered, can't find anything 
The link you sent doesn't make sense either
Apr 10, 11:34 PM - Mojo: Under otcl make works. Not under ns 2.35
Apr 10, 11:44 PM - Mojo: Got it to work. Make error though.
Apr 10, 11:44 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Apr 10, 11:44 PM - Mojo: Built in the allinone folder

Apr 15, 8:17 AM - Mojo: 10
Apr 15, 7:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Check with Sangeetha about their hardware?
Apr 15, 9:15 PM - Mojo: They've finished the coding part. Need to discuss with the guide about HwaRE
Apr 15, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What've they coded?
Apr 16, 8:32 AM - Mojo: No clue.
Apr 16, 8:33 AM - Mojo: I'll be a little late. Work at RTO

Apr 16, 8:47 AM - Mojo: Porto Bayern😳😳
Apr 16, 9:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Awesome stuff. I watched.
Apr 16, 8:37 PM - Mojo: I'll look up some hardware today
Apr 16, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think hardware is still at the experimental stage.
Apr 16, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think we should reinforce that point constantly. That we're working on something that is in the research stage the world over.
Apr 16, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the reason devices cost $100
Apr 16, 9:21 PM - Mojo: Yeah
Apr 16, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You saw marks breakup?
Apr 16, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We only lost out coz of funding
Apr 16, 9:30 PM - Mojo: Yeah?
Apr 16, 9:30 PM - Mojo: How the hell did others get marks then?
Apr 16, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We got "no attempt made"
Apr 16, 9:31 PM - Mojo: Others also should have lost marks no?
Apr 16, 9:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Look at mekali's most recent email.
Apr 16, 9:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's attached the breakdown.
Apr 16, 9:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Lots of people have submitted the form for namesake apparently.
Apr 16, 9:55 PM - Mojo: Sucks. We should have
Apr 16, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah :/ I thought they'd screwed us over, but that's not true. 
Presentation and questions they've cut, but that can't be helped.
Apr 16, 10:01 PM - Mojo: Annoying
Apr 16, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We got 0.8 out of 3.2
Apr 16, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Could've had 2.4
Apr 16, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They'd round up to 36 I think.
Apr 16, 10:05 PM - Mojo: Fuck!
Apr 17, 8:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What time today?
Apr 17, 8:16 AM - Mojo: 10 30

Apr 21, 11:24 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
Apr 21, 11:25 PM - Mojo: Takes too long
Apr 21, 11:25 PM - Mojo: It doesn't keep changing like the previous protocols. Displayed at the end
Apr 21, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You want this sort of graph at the end?
Apr 21, 11:26 PM - Mojo: Yeah. To figure out which nodes aren't dying
Apr 21, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay
Apr 21, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Staying up to watch Munich crash and burn?
Apr 21, 11:27 PM - Mojo: Takes too long
Apr 21, 11:27 PM - Mojo: Might
Apr 21, 11:27 PM - Mojo: Can't figure out why
Apr 21, 11:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think the sensed values are too small. So no transmission occurs.
Apr 21, 11:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or maybe the nodes aren't allowed to transmit directly when their cluster heads die
Apr 21, 11:30 PM - Mojo: Yeah.. Still packets are being sent to the bs
Apr 21, 11:31 PM - Mojo: How does that happen?
Apr 21, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That doesn't make sense. Wait, I'll plot
Apr 21, 11:31 PM - Mojo: See the report?
Apr 21, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: SLEEP :P
Apr 21, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't really describe what goes on though
Apr 21, 11:34 PM - Mojo: Yeah. Couldn't think of a better name
Apr 21, 11:34 PM - Mojo: SLEAZE?
Apr 21, 11:34 PM - Mojo: 😂😂
Apr 21, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Need it to stand for something :P
Apr 21, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I like Aash
Apr 21, 11:36 PM - Mojo: Aash?
Apr 21, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Repeat looks alright. We'll make changes if required as we go along.
Apr 21, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Async something something hierarchy
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Mojo: Cool
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just for fun :P
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Mojo: Need to finish coding tomorrow
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Mojo: No time after that
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. And have the talk with mekali.
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't see the review happening early next week.
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Idiots haven't notified anyone yet.
Apr 21, 11:37 PM - Mojo: I'll be there by 12. Aunts house warming ceremony
Apr 21, 11:38 PM - Mojo: Mid next week mostly
Apr 21, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sure
Apr 24, 6:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 24, 6:29 PM - Mojo: 😂
Apr 24, 6:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Madness!
Apr 24, 6:30 PM - Mojo: Shady written all over it
Apr 25, 6:41 PM - Mojo: Look at the report?
Apr 25, 7:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No Bob
Apr 25, 7:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll do it. I'll keep you posted.
Apr 25, 7:12 PM - Mojo: 👍
Apr 25, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Made it to your bus?
Apr 25, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No traffic/rain issues?
Apr 25, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So mekali just screwed everyone over with his report format.
Apr 25, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's exactly what latex does for you. Indexes images and shit like that. Everyone's fuming.
Apr 26, 8:02 AM - Mojo: Awesome
Apr 26, 8:03 AM - Mojo: #hvm
Apr 26, 5:58 PM - Mojo: How's the report coming along?
Apr 26, 5:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Decent. Getting aasish to come up with more tests to make that section comprehensive.
Apr 26, 5:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The problem now is the paper submission. The free ones expect the entire paper to be submitted. That's impossible. Need to find one where only an abstract will do for now.
Apr 26, 6:00 PM - Mojo: Crap
Apr 26, 6:00 PM - Mojo: We'll talk to him tomorrow
Apr 27, 8:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Please bring your laptop as well.
Apr 27, 8:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Lots of work.
Apr 27, 9:09 AM - Mojo: Okay
Apr 27, 8:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=13.0064369,77.6520962
Apr 27, 8:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 4th B, not A.
Apr 27, 8:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The adjacent road.
Apr 27, 8:50 PM - Mojo: Cool. I'll leave by 9 15
Apr 28, 10:07 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 60 pages Bob.
Apr 28, 10:07 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently what I'd set wasn't 1.5 linespacing
Apr 28, 10:28 AM - Mojo: Haha no wayyyy
Apr 28, 10:28 AM - Mojo: Dayum
Apr 28, 10:28 AM - Mojo: Trippy stuff bhah
Apr 28, 10:28 AM - Mojo: Brah*
Apr 28, 10:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You're in college now
Apr 28, 10:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: ?
Apr 28, 7:21 PM - Mojo: Get CCleaner tomorrow no
Apr 28, 7:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's 5MB. Download?
Apr 28, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What're we doing tomorrow?
Apr 28, 8:36 PM - Mojo: Ppt and prep work
Apr 28, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: College P
Apr 28, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ?
Apr 28, 9:43 PM - Mojo: Yeah
Apr 29, 9:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Where do I meet you?
Apr 29, 9:34 AM - Mojo: Metro?
Apr 29, 9:37 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yep
Apr 29, 9:40 AM - Mojo: When you leaving?
Apr 29, 9:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm leaving for the station now. Hoping to get on the 9:50
Apr 29, 9:44 AM - Mojo: Cool
Apr 29, 9:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Where do I meet you though?
Apr 29, 9:51 AM - Mojo: Coffee day near the metro station
Apr 29, 9:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll be there at 10:10
Apr 29, 11:33 PM - Mojo: Find any paper format n Tex?
Apr 29, 11:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No Bob, I haven't searched. I'll do that tomorrow in the morning. I can do the formatting myself anyway. Not an issue.
Apr 29, 11:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are we expected to create the poster for the orjectP
Apr 29, 11:35 PM - Mojo: Yup. I'll ask Adi to send his postet
Apr 29, 11:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay
Apr 29, 11:35 PM - Mojo: Poster*
Apr 29, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Paper, I think we should say we have the draft ready but didn't submit it yet coz there's time.
Apr 29, 11:36 PM - Mojo: College?
Apr 29, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aashish wasn't aware that we only submitted the abstract.
Apr 29, 11:36 PM - Mojo: Yeah.
Apr 29, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. If in case they ask.
Apr 29, 11:37 PM - Mojo: Cool
Apr 29, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meanwhile we'll get it written and actually submit somewhere.
Apr 29, 11:37 PM - Mojo: What plans tomorrow then?
Apr 29, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm up for anything.
Apr 29, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aanch is back in the morning.
Apr 29, 11:37 PM - Mojo: Yeah. Skype if you want to discuss about it
Apr 29, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She should be free too.
Apr 29, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not right now Bob. I'm falling asleep
Apr 29, 11:38 PM - Mojo: They're going to college to work on their project
Apr 29, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like Monday night :P
Apr 29, 11:38 PM - Mojo: And off to Ayeshas place
Apr 29, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah? What work?
Apr 29, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought it was all done
Apr 29, 11:39 PM - Mojo: I meant Skype tomorrow about the paper if you're not coming to college
Apr 29, 11:39 PM - Mojo: Discuss and fine tune
Apr 29, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, but I thought they'd finished the project in ISRO
Apr 29, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In any case there's nothing for them to show as a demonstration
Apr 29, 11:40 PM - Mojo: Yeah
Apr 29, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "They worked hard.."
Apr 29, 11:41 PM - Mojo: Lol
Apr 29, 11:41 PM - Mojo: Didn't all of us
Apr 29, 11:41 PM - Mojo: 😂
Apr 29, 11:41 PM - Mojo: Especially merging 2 algorithms
Apr 29, 11:42 PM - Mojo: Like combining gin and tonic
Apr 29, 11:42 PM - Mojo: Perfect
Apr 29, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This project is such a lie! But Sudheendra is the worst.
Apr 29, 11:42 PM - Mojo: :p
Apr 29, 11:42 PM - Mojo: Yeah. Rip off.
Apr 29, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: From the way he kept going on during our presentation, I expected some insane shit from their group.
Apr 29, 11:42 PM - Mojo: Biased idiot
Apr 29, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its sick. Need to make mekali aware of it. I think it might help.
Apr 29, 11:43 PM - Mojo: I'm tempted to bring that up of he mentions anything
Apr 29, 11:43 PM - Mojo: Yup.
Apr 29, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We can't get into an argument with him. Mekali can.
Apr 29, 11:43 PM - Mojo: That way he can help us out if he asks it again
Apr 29, 11:43 PM - Mojo: Yeah.
Apr 29, 11:43 PM - Mojo: Hail HVM
Apr 29, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Staying up for the match?
Apr 29, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm going to pass out any moment now
Apr 29, 11:44 PM - Mojo: We've answered most of HVMs questions. Hoping he'll help us
Apr 29, 11:44 PM - Mojo: Good night bob
Apr 29, 11:44 PM - Mojo: Yup
Apr 29, 11:44 PM - Mojo: Title time🏆🏆😝
Apr 29, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Haha! Try not to fall asleep :P
Apr 29, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night!
Apr 29, 11:45 PM - Mojo: Lol
Apr 30, 9:38 AM - Mojo: 11?
Apr 30, 9:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. Should be there by then.
Apr 30, 11:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Got stuck in some riot.
Apr 30, 11:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll be there soon.
Apr 30, 11:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Near town hall now.
May 1, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is there any alternative background for the slides?
May 1, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The tower is a distraction on every slide. Messes with the content.
May 1, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, we haven't done the 1 node for every 10m^2
May 1, 10:38 PM - Mojo: Fixed it
May 1, 10:39 PM - Mojo: Hmm
May 1, 10:39 PM - Mojo: Should I remove it
May 1, 10:39 PM - Mojo: ?
May 1, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Let me see if there's an alternative picture. It makes text hard to read.
May 1, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I increased transparency. It's better now.
May 1, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There are actually three levels of probability in our code?
May 1, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's quite a bit of explanation to do to arrive at why there levels is required.
May 1, 11:23 PM - Mojo: Yeah
May 1, 11:24 PM - Mojo: That's why I wanted to make those changes
May 1, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I see what you mean.
May 1, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Here's what I propose
May 1, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For the sake of explanations, lets go with DEEC
May 1, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: keep it in a separate file, mark areas that pertain to particular explanations out.
May 1, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For the sake of the demo, everything will have to run in one program so the plots can happen.
May 1, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That program need not be shown clearly to them. Just a skim.
May 1, 11:26 PM - Mojo: Hmm yeah...but no way of changing it
May 1, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because even as an explanation, its a little far fetched that we thought of all those concepts on our own.
May 1, 11:26 PM - Mojo: ?
May 1, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's all
May 1, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Otherwise I'm up for changing it.
May 1, 11:26 PM - Mojo: We'll just create a separate page for this explanation
May 1, 11:27 PM - Mojo: We'll add it after asking Aash
May 1, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll see if I can add a simplified explanation.
May 1, 11:27 PM - Mojo: Yeah
May 1, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll keep it ready just in case.
May 1, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll fix things in the morning. Need to get there early and prep.
May 1, 11:27 PM - Mojo: Just try to bring in b const and 3 levels of prob.
May 1, 11:28 PM - Mojo: Yeah
May 1, 11:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay. I'm still wrapping my head around the DDEEC concepts.
May 1, 11:28 PM - Mojo: Call me up if you don't get it. Read through it for an hour to understand some of it
May 1, 11:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I get why its required. The advanced nodes have the factor 1+a
May 1, 11:29 PM - Mojo: Still didn't understand a few bits
May 1, 11:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why they're more likely to be picked.
May 1, 11:30 PM - Mojo: Yeah. In brief. Confusing part is the equations
May 1, 11:30 PM - Mojo: Doze of any second now
May 1, 11:30 PM - Mojo: Need to change this cycle
May 1, 11:30 PM - Mojo: You'll work it out?
May 1, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yep. Get some sleep. I'll leave you messages
May 1, 11:31 PM - Mojo: Cool
May 1, 11:31 PM - Mojo: Night
May 1, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night!
May 2, 6:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've put the paper on dropbox. Something preliminary, mostly stuff from the report.
May 2, 11:12 PM - Mojo: United suck
May 2, 11:12 PM - Mojo: Like watching a barca game
May 2, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tiring
May 2, 11:37 PM - Mojo: Called?
May 2, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Called by mistake Bob. Really sleepy.
May 2, 11:37 PM - Mojo: 😂
May 2, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In a daze.
May 2, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's that time again 😓
May 2, 11:38 PM - Mojo: The match has that effect
May 2, 11:38 PM - Mojo: Lol.. You sound like you have periods
May 2, 11:38 PM - Mojo: :p
May 2, 11:39 PM - Mojo: Making changes to the report?
May 2, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Haha! But 11:30 - 12 everyday is too overwhelming
May 2, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, had mass and stuff. I'll do that tomorow in the morning
May 2, 11:39 PM - Mojo: Yeah.. Eyes start to feel heavy
May 2, 11:40 PM - Mojo: Yeah sure..Ddeec paper is our ref for the report
May 2, 11:40 PM - Mojo: Need to understand that
May 3, 9:43 PM - Mojo: Call?
May 4, 6:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You're up?
May 4, 6:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've made some changes to the ppt. The version we created on Saturday isn't on Dropbox, I think it's on your system offline.
May 4, 6:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Merge the changes?
May 4, 6:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, did anyone salvage our poster?
May 4, 7:47 AM - Mojo: Aashish has it I think
May 4, 11:53 AM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
May 4, 11:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm still outside, can't see clearly
May 4, 11:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll tell you in a bit
May 4, 11:57 AM - Mojo: It's dark grey
May 4, 11:57 AM - Mojo: Cool
May 4, 11:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Some shade of pink?
May 4, 11:58 AM - Mojo: Don't have one
May 4, 11:58 AM - Mojo: Any other color?
May 4, 12:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Reddish?
May 4, 12:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you have?
May 4, 12:14 PM - Mojo: Maroon
May 4, 12:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Should be alright
May 4, 12:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Send me a picture
May 4, 12:14 PM - Mojo: <Media omitted>
May 4, 12:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It goes
May 5, 8:43 PM - Mojo: Should we go to Iisc or screw it?
May 5, 8:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We should go.
May 5, 8:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But we need to talk to them first.
May 5, 8:44 PM - Mojo: You'll draft a mail?
May 5, 8:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Try sending another email out? If there's no response, message bhaktha tomorrow?
May 5, 8:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No more damage can be done.
May 5, 8:44 PM - Mojo: Hmm okay
May 5, 8:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It'll impress the external. They'll buy into the project if there seems to be IISc behind it.
May 5, 8:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Otherwise, screwed.
May 5, 8:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: PlanB tomorrow?
May 5, 8:45 PM - Mojo: We need to send soft copy of our project materials to Mekali ?
May 5, 8:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes. And that CD shit.
May 5, 8:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Completely forgot.
May 5, 8:46 PM - Mojo: Who s coming?
May 5, 8:46 PM - Mojo: Should we ask Niraash to do it?
May 5, 8:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm still asking people. Aanch and manika can. I think adi has NI.
May 5, 8:46 PM - Mojo: I'll ask Prableen
May 5, 8:46 PM - Mojo: Aash?
May 5, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aash wanted to go there yesterday.
May 5, 8:47 PM - Mojo: Oh
May 5, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've left him a message. Waiting.
May 5, 8:48 PM - Mojo: Ask Cherry also
May 5, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😑
May 5, 8:48 PM - Mojo: She'll come
May 5, 8:48 PM - Mojo: Lol why?
May 5, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's terrible company.
May 5, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She won't even drink. Just sit and stare.
May 5, 8:48 PM - Mojo: You can make fun of her
May 5, 8:48 PM - Mojo: She will
May 5, 8:48 PM - Mojo: She wanted to atleast
May 5, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You ask her then
May 5, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When did she want to?
May 5, 8:49 PM - Mojo: Watching the game tonight?
May 5, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's tonight?
May 5, 8:49 PM - Mojo: Juve?
May 5, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh it's tonight?
May 5, 8:49 PM - Mojo: Prableen can't make it
May 5, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Lost track of time
May 5, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why not?
May 5, 8:50 PM - Mojo: Lol why?
May 5, 8:50 PM - Mojo: Going out with grandparents
May 5, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I forgot it was time for semis. Our weekend was all about the stupid project.
May 5, 8:51 PM - Mojo: Yeah.. All for nothing
May 5, 8:51 PM - Mojo: Twenty minutes about Hardware
May 5, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He thought LEAP was LEACH!
May 5, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That was his big takeaway.
May 5, 8:52 PM - Mojo: Tempted to tell the HID
May 5, 8:52 PM - Mojo: hOd
May 5, 8:52 PM - Mojo: Yeah. Stupid mofo
May 5, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Our title couldn't be clearer.
May 5, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That should've been the first question.
May 5, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "Where's the algorithm that is new?"
May 5, 8:53 PM - Mojo: Yeah...unfortunately it was "Hardware?"
May 5, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Depending on the marks we need to raise a few points.
May 5, 8:54 PM - Mojo: Yes
May 5, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll talk to hod if it's required.
May 5, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He can't do anymore damage.
May 5, 8:54 PM - Mojo: Yeah. We'll talk to Mekali first and see
May 6, 9:37 AM - Mojo: What plans?
May 6, 9:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: College, then IISc.
May 6, 1:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
May 7, 7:24 AM - Mojo: You'll make changes to the or report?
May 7, 7:35 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Aash said he'll send me a paper draft in 48 hours.
May 7, 7:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Meanwhile we need to verify if there's any genuine gain in the project we've done.
May 7, 7:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Report changes I'll do.
May 7, 7:41 AM - Mojo: Cool
May 7, 7:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: By when do we need to get it printed and bound?
May 7, 7:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I think we should this week.
May 7, 7:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Next week we've exams. The following week we start with seminar. I think we follow into the external project review.
May 7, 7:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, I don't know if Aash has sent mekali the soft copy but according to the email he won't assign us a slot for review if we don't.
May 7, 7:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't deal with writing an apology letter again. Did it once already :/
May 7, 7:56 AM - Mojo: I'll mail whatever we have?
May 7, 7:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know if he's done it already. I'd told him day before I think.
May 7, 8:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Scrotal Recall (TV Series 2014– ) - IMDb - http://m.imdb.com/title/tt4051832/
May 7, 8:43 AM - Mojo: 😂😂
May 7, 8:43 AM - Mojo: Haha
May 7, 8:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's a pdf called hybrid routing protocol dissertation
May 7, 8:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The way he's presented it is awesome. Extremely comprehensive.
May 7, 8:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: For our modifications we should refer here. I'm tempted to just rip the whole thing off, it's that good.
May 7, 9:23 AM - Mojo: Then go ahead..
May 12, 6:36 PM - Mojo: What do I mention in the mail?
May 12, 8:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just that we need to get our books signed, before next Tuesday
May 12, 8:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So when can be stop by
May 12, 9:04 PM - Mojo: Okay
May 13, 8:03 PM - Mojo: He'll get  the bonafide signed
May 13, 8:03 PM - Mojo: Spoke to him
May 13, 8:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay
May 13, 8:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just mail and ask if it's okay to come with just that much
