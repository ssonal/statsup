Nov 16, 2014, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You were so much more excited to be talking on the phone, being greeted by your other friends, than to be with me..
Nov 16, 2014, 10:45 PM - Yashmitha: I don't Sona. I can't, rather :/
Nov 16, 2014, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its like everything we wished for came true and yet it didn't

Nov 16, 2014, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's not a nice way to treat someone
Nov 16, 2014, 10:51 PM - Yashmitha: You're not part of my other life because you don't involve people you've dated in your friend's circle, it's weird for them also 😕
Nov 16, 2014, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: OK.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One more thing, the fact that you decided to steal my bed sheet, not give me any during the entire night when it was so cold was very shitty of you.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:53 PM - Yashmitha: You made my birthday special! Except for a few things I really didn't like. But it's okay
Nov 16, 2014, 10:53 PM - Yashmitha: What? Lol. You are so immature.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: That was a bed sheet for one person. You were the host, I was the guest. Unless you got me another one I'd take this obviously. Go man. Grow up a little.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: Couldn't you get another? Dumbass.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Where's your heart?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You just let mr freeze?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Was I supposed to get a ladder and climb onto the shelf for this ?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:56 PM - Yashmitha: I fucking gave you the sheet & you pushed it away. How dumb are you?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In the middle of the nigh
Nov 16, 2014, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't your dare swear at me.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It might cut it with your other friends, but it doesn't with me.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like it and you know that
Nov 16, 2014, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why do you want make me angry?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:56 PM - Yashmitha: Didn't you people are sleeping over?? Why didn't you have something as simple as a fucking bed sheet ready?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:57 PM - Yashmitha: I don't care. If you can hear it, well & good, I don't have to talk.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:57 PM - Yashmitha: Every single birthday we fight. Why did I even come stay over at your place yesterday?
Nov 16, 2014, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You made me feel like a pariah..
Nov 16, 2014, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wanted to make the day special for you..
Nov 16, 2014, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It sucked.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I shouldn't have tried..
Nov 16, 2014, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its so different, you with others and you with me .m
Nov 16, 2014, 10:59 PM - Yashmitha: You tried too many things. Which I obviously wouldn't tolerate.
Nov 16, 2014, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're so nice to them..
Nov 16, 2014, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It sucks..
Nov 16, 2014, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You made me seem like I'm something in your life and then it all comes crashing down
Nov 16, 2014, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And its days like this that are the worst.. You choose to not even make Mr a part of your plans
Nov 16, 2014, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If I ignored you? On my birthday? Would you feel good? Happy?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I just cannot win you over no matter what I do..
Nov 16, 2014, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: No you can't! I don't want to be won over. Please just stop trying 😞
Nov 16, 2014, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There comes a point, and that point is close.. I'm exhausted
Nov 16, 2014, 11:04 PM - Yashmitha: I didn't ignore you for no reason. I was creeped out by yesterday. 😳
Nov 16, 2014, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You were creeped out by me?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I wanted to hold you and sleep?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: Yes! What the Fuck was that thing you did when you said happy 21st?? 😳
Nov 16, 2014, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: I'm sorry but all this is too uncomfortable for me 😐
Nov 16, 2014, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wanted to give you a fucking hug
Nov 16, 2014, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't make me feel like some weirdo!
Nov 16, 2014, 11:06 PM - Yashmitha: Well, if you're sleepy as hell and someone's positioned like that, trust me it's scary as hell.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: OK.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What did you think I was going to do?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you insane?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't be so sick!
Nov 16, 2014, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: No. I thought you were gonna kiss me.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've never done anything you didn't want me to do.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've given you that physical space.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Not without hinting that you want more
Nov 16, 2014, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: I don't wanna talk about this
Nov 16, 2014, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hinting? Nothing more than what you've asked for.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So please.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't make me out to be the only one.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think this gets any better for me.. You have lofty thoughts about how our friendship transcends everything and then you tell me you can not include me in plans with friends.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its not a nice feeling,
Nov 16, 2014, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've never ever done that to you..
Nov 16, 2014, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Either you're my friend, and you treat me that way, or we're walking away from this tonight
Nov 16, 2014, 11:14 PM - Yashmitha: Friend, I can be bub. Nothing more. I'm serious. I'll walk away if you can't do that.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We could form a group of friends. You know that.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You choose not to. As though you're too cool for me.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:14 PM - Yashmitha: But I can't ever date you again. Please don't force me.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can show up for my birthday, but if I do, some sheen is lost .
Nov 16, 2014, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or some standard is lost.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've become so vain now.. Can't hang out with people you've dated it seems. What the fuck?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How should I react?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:16 PM - Yashmitha: What. I'm serious! It's weird!
Nov 16, 2014, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its weird for you when you're with me?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:16 PM - Yashmitha: Sometimes
Nov 16, 2014, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: Listen. I'll talk tomorrow. Don't wanna ruin a nice day
Nov 16, 2014, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 👍
Nov 16, 2014, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We're probably done okay? Just FYI
Nov 16, 2014, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've heard and experienced enough today.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Every birthday you show me my place.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Thanks for everything.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Happy birthday again.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So much for "friends for all eternity".
Nov 16, 2014, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All bets and pacts are off. You treat me like shit, I don't care about you anymore. I'll talk about you also freely.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:20 PM - Yashmitha: I'll reply tomorrow. Good night
Nov 16, 2014, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That tells me enough already.
Nov 16, 2014, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wish you understood how you're the only one I've ever shared with and this pain this is causing me..
Nov 16, 2014, 11:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you there?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can we please talk now?
Nov 16, 2014, 11:30 PM - Yashmitha: Tomorrow. I really can't do this
Nov 16, 2014, 11:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I won't have peacr of mind till then..
Nov 16, 2014, 11:31 PM - Yashmitha: Tomorrow morning if you like. Not now. I want to sleep peacefully, not fight
Nov 16, 2014, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not trying to fight..
Nov 16, 2014, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I spent one day being consumed by this already
Nov 16, 2014, 11:32 PM - Yashmitha: Bub, please. Tomorrow morning when I wake up we'll talk. Can't now. Too sleepy
Nov 16, 2014, 11:32 PM - Yashmitha: Good night
Nov 16, 2014, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: OK
Nov 16, 2014, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Night
Nov 17, 2014, 5:32 PM - Yashmitha: Hey
Nov 17, 2014, 5:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hey
Nov 17, 2014, 5:51 PM - Yashmitha: I heard you mom's really upset that we slept over?
Nov 17, 2014, 5:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How you heard?
Nov 17, 2014, 5:52 PM - Yashmitha: Mom told me. Apparently she had called asking if she knew where I was that night 😳
Nov 17, 2014, 5:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh..
Nov 17, 2014, 5:58 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. You should have ensured that she doesn't know.. Your parents aren't exactly chill that way. Obviously this would upset her
Nov 17, 2014, 5:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:01 PM - Yashmitha: No re. I don't like when it seems like my parents aren't worried about their daughter & I'm allowed to do Wtv the hell I want. I don't want my mom to have to hear that from anybody.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sorry it happened that way..
Nov 17, 2014, 6:02 PM - Yashmitha: I came there for you. Not because I'm one of those girls that's so chill that does stuff like staying at guy's houses without her mom knowing.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:02 PM - Yashmitha: You're never cautious about these things.. Nothing has changed 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 6:03 PM - Yashmitha: Always told you. I don't like being spoken about. Why on earth would you put the whole attention on me?
Nov 17, 2014, 6:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Look, I was cautious.. I had to tell her coz neighbors saw us walking in
Nov 17, 2014, 6:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Pushpa saw us when we arrived earlier
Nov 17, 2014, 6:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Imagine her telling my mom later?
Nov 17, 2014, 6:04 PM - Yashmitha: Why didn't you wait till the neighbours weren't around?? You don't know how to sneak in?
Nov 17, 2014, 6:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There were bikes outside
Nov 17, 2014, 6:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How does it make sense to sneak in?
Nov 17, 2014, 6:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its almost impossible
Nov 17, 2014, 6:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll talk to my mom. I don't know why she would do that.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:06 PM - Yashmitha: No point. That's just a dumb argument because you are not stupid. You could have made them park elsewhere.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't think it'd turn out this way
Nov 17, 2014, 6:07 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo 
Horrible. You mom will never leave you alone again though 😂
Nov 17, 2014, 6:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm going to scold her..
Nov 17, 2014, 6:08 PM - Yashmitha: Don't! 😂
Nov 17, 2014, 6:09 PM - Yashmitha: It's not her fault. We both have parents coming from very strict backgrounds. They're not going to learn to deal with these things & it's not their fault
Nov 17, 2014, 6:09 PM - Yashmitha: You don't say anything to her. I swear I'll stop talking to you 😒
Nov 17, 2014, 6:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: OK cool.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:18 PM - Yashmitha: My back is fucked.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:18 PM - Yashmitha: Like really badly. I can't even get off the bed.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh.. Get well soon
Nov 17, 2014, 6:20 PM - Yashmitha: Thanks.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
Nov 17, 2014, 6:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you don't mind, I'd rather not pretend like everything's okay. If you want to talk to me, talk about this. Or don't talk.
Nov 17, 2014, 7:42 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. Tell me what you want me to talk about
Nov 17, 2014, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. I said much that you did not reply to.
Nov 17, 2014, 7:46 PM - Yashmitha: Chotu.. I like you. It's mostly admiration for the genius in you. But love, cannot happen again for me..
Nov 17, 2014, 7:47 PM - Yashmitha: That's why getting physical wasn't really comfortable for me that day
Nov 17, 2014, 7:47 PM - Yashmitha: Other than that, I do hang out with you. You can't complain that I spend more time with people I'm in college with
Nov 17, 2014, 7:48 PM - Yashmitha: That's obvious, we're in the same class. And we don't even go out much. I'm home doing nothing almost every weekend
Nov 17, 2014, 7:48 PM - Yashmitha: And I meet you pretty often. Even if I don't, I talk to you. Still share everything with you.
Nov 17, 2014, 7:49 PM - Yashmitha: You won't even be comfortable around people in college. They're pretty dim witted. I'd rather you me & tiny one hang out. Maybe Arvind too. Whatever. But college & all, no.. I wouldn't want that
Nov 17, 2014, 7:50 PM - Yashmitha: You need to stop feeling weird about that. I'm hanging out with you, right? Why does it matter who else is there?
Nov 17, 2014, 7:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Did I mention that I had a problem with others? I had a problem that I wasn't part of tour plans
Nov 17, 2014, 7:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who the hell cares if they're dimwits?
Nov 17, 2014, 7:52 PM - Yashmitha: Why should you be part of every plan man?? Isn't it enough that I make plans exclusively for you?
Nov 17, 2014, 7:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And should you have said you don't hang out with exes?
Nov 17, 2014, 7:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You made one birthday plan and ← me out no?
Nov 17, 2014, 7:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *Left
Nov 17, 2014, 7:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't complain otherwise
Nov 17, 2014, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's weird, as though you're avoiding me
Nov 17, 2014, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't do that. Anyone I'm close to, I offer to take you to meet
Nov 17, 2014, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes or no?
Nov 17, 2014, 7:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't say anything about the trek or about nh7 or anything else
Nov 17, 2014, 8:03 PM - Yashmitha: I didn't leave you out of my birthday or something chotu! What shit? I was willing to start it off with you!
Nov 17, 2014, 8:04 PM - Yashmitha: And the rest of the plan didn't involve anyone other than college friends! Not like I took other people who aren't in college & left you out. It wasn't even my plan, it was theirs.
Nov 17, 2014, 8:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Nov 17, 2014, 8:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay.
Nov 17, 2014, 8:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay.
Nov 17, 2014, 8:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay..
Nov 17, 2014, 8:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You really don't love me anymore ?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why didn't you want to stay up and talk to me? That night? That's what I was waiting for ..
Nov 17, 2014, 8:09 PM - Yashmitha: Oh goodness..
Nov 17, 2014, 8:09 PM - Yashmitha: Please stop thinking I have something against you..
Nov 17, 2014, 8:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some things are very hard to stomach.. Especially when I do things differently
Nov 17, 2014, 8:10 PM - Yashmitha: Don't ask nonsense questions. 
I don't know! You should have told me to stay up no? I would have done that 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You repeatedly told me you wanted to sleep.
Nov 17, 2014, 8:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why do you think I was sitting up and looking at you?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then finally I had no choice, I went off to sleep
Nov 17, 2014, 8:12 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:12 PM - Yashmitha: Okay. That's not nice. I'm sorry 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing was nice about that day..
Nov 17, 2014, 8:13 PM - Yashmitha: I thought it was nice 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I repeatedly wondered if you're sick of me and why you even shower up if you didn't want to spend time with me
Nov 17, 2014, 8:14 PM - Yashmitha: I wasn't sick of you.. But I didn't want you to get your hopes up about us 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Nov 17, 2014, 8:19 PM - Yashmitha: Is this too hard for you? You can opt to end it.. If you feel like it's mundane 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its not mundane. Its this thing where you're trying very hard to, for the lack of a better word, sabotage it..
Nov 17, 2014, 8:24 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not.. 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:24 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know, I don't feel like I'm wronging you 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wish you'd say yes to me.. I want to show you the best days we've ever had .. 😞
Nov 17, 2014, 8:27 PM - Yashmitha: Bubba.. Honestly you don't deserve someone like me. I hope you find a girl who's actually a nice person 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:27 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not. Really not. I'm cocky & all that even in a relationship.. It's not even funny. You're too nice 😕
Nov 17, 2014, 8:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told my principal about no shave November 😂
Nov 17, 2014, 8:28 PM - Yashmitha: You're kidding me?? 😂😂😂
Nov 17, 2014, 8:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And I complained about how BMS isn't listed in any of the colheges
Nov 17, 2014, 8:28 PM - Yashmitha: What did he say?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He said ohh and then he said he wish he knew
Nov 17, 2014, 8:29 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo. So you are allowed to keep the beard? 😂
Nov 17, 2014, 8:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He invited me to a BMS board meeting
Nov 17, 2014, 8:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I said next time 😝
Nov 17, 2014, 8:30 PM - Yashmitha: Pricey 😂😂😂
Nov 17, 2014, 8:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And I'm on some syllabus revision forum .
Nov 17, 2014, 8:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I actually insulted him you know? I said Stanford has BMSIT but no CE
Nov 17, 2014, 8:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😁
Nov 17, 2014, 8:32 PM - Yashmitha: Shit. Badass. Why they called you
Nov 17, 2014, 8:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: See how badly I got hurt?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I walked into this steel frame
Nov 17, 2014, 8:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He called coz at every board meeting they have a students interaction bit
Nov 17, 2014, 8:36 PM - Yashmitha: Shit!! How did this happen? It's really bad 😳
Nov 17, 2014, 8:36 PM - Yashmitha: Dumbass
Nov 17, 2014, 8:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In part of something called the propel labs program okay ?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why
Nov 17, 2014, 8:37 PM - Yashmitha: Oh.. Okay okay
Nov 17, 2014, 8:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know, there was a lock hole on one side of the wall outside the door, I walked into that when I walked out
Nov 17, 2014, 8:37 PM - Yashmitha: Mental only. Shirt tore?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No chance
Nov 17, 2014, 8:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm so strong :p
Nov 17, 2014, 8:38 PM - Yashmitha: Oh. I see 😝
Nov 17, 2014, 8:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That thing is slightly bent now you know?

Nov 17, 2014, 8:38 PM - Yashmitha: People saw?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:38 PM - Yashmitha: Iron Man 😂😂
Nov 17, 2014, 8:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, can't lock using that anymore
Nov 17, 2014, 8:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They're calling someone to have it replaced tomorrow
Nov 17, 2014, 8:39 PM - Yashmitha: Bubba that's too funny 😂😂😂

Nov 17, 2014, 8:41 PM - Yashmitha: 8
Nov 17, 2014, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's all? What happened?
Nov 17, 2014, 8:50 PM - Yashmitha: Pugs don't have that long to live apparently
Nov 17, 2014, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Nov 17, 2014, 8:51 PM - Yashmitha: 😓

Nov 17, 2014, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki? You might think you're cocky so you're not right for me .. The same way, I also have many deficiencies
Nov 17, 2014, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But all I want right now is for us to make the best of our time together
Nov 17, 2014, 8:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think being apart has made us better people so it'll work well for us
Nov 17, 2014, 8:55 PM - Yashmitha: 😞
Nov 17, 2014, 8:55 PM - Yashmitha: Please bubba..

Nov 17, 2014, 9:00 PM - Yashmitha: I don't want it bubba.. I can't 😞

Nov 17, 2014, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Never going to happen 😊
Nov 17, 2014, 9:04 PM - Yashmitha: That's not true. Haha. I saw that it's possible during the whole Shruti thing 😄
Nov 17, 2014, 9:04 PM - Yashmitha: Moving on is a matter of choice re

Nov 23, 2014, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
Nov 23, 2014, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You want to move on when you don't have to..

Nov 23, 2014, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: We barely worked well as a couple. Maybe just one year 😐
Nov 23, 2014, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't remember properly.
Nov 23, 2014, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. It's been long..
Nov 23, 2014, 11:51 PM - Yashmitha: Idk why you just won't date Manika! She's so sweet, pretty, just like me!
Nov 23, 2014, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Me + you = fun
Nov 23, 2014, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why would I give something like this up?
Nov 23, 2014, 11:53 PM - Yashmitha: Because I already gave up.. If something comes along, I won't even hesitate re. I can't do this 😐
Nov 23, 2014, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Look, I honestly like you okay? Really. I wouldn't do this otherwise.
Nov 23, 2014, 11:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're planning to go out with someone?
Nov 23, 2014, 11:56 PM - Yashmitha: I'm flattered.. But I can't do this re.. 😐

Nov 23, 2014, 11:58 PM - Yashmitha: You don't plan these things Dumbass. If they happen, they happen!
Nov 23, 2014, 11:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is that why you're giving me some sort of headsup before the news breaks?
Nov 23, 2014, 11:59 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. One year I'll give you headsup for? 😂
Nov 23, 2014, 11:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What one year?

Nov 24, 2014, 12:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm telling you I just want to make you happy?
Nov 24, 2014, 12:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki we've grown up! I just want you to see that! I don't want to live a life full of regret, thinking about how I made things go bad.. I want this to be my happy place.. I want to have only the happiest of memories, not ones of guilt
Nov 24, 2014, 12:08 AM - Yashmitha: You're irritating my sleep Dumbass!
Nov 24, 2014, 12:08 AM - Yashmitha: Good night 😠

Nov 24, 2014, 8:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I get it..
Nov 24, 2014, 7:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Nov 24, 2014, 8:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm losing my mind Chutki.. I'm not kidding when I say I need you.. I need to hold onto something <<>>
Nov 24, 2014, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: You have me chummu.. I don't know why you think otherwise 😐

Nov 24, 2014, 9:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like.. You tell me I should find someone else but it's not about that for me 
It's not about just anyone. It's not about needing to date someone.
Nov 24, 2014, 9:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's about having an escape.. A safe place
Nov 24, 2014, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: We really need to talk.. We haven't in really long, hence the issues
Nov 24, 2014, 9:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Nov 24, 2014, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's very difficult for me when I start feeling like I'm not important to you and things like that
Nov 24, 2014, 9:39 PM - Yashmitha: Worst part is that I come home & just sleep. Sooo tired.
Nov 24, 2014, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's all I've ever wanted, all my life
Nov 24, 2014, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No?

Nov 24, 2014, 9:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Every fight that happens originates there only..
Nov 24, 2014, 9:40 PM - Yashmitha: I don't think I can go a day without thinking about how important you are & that I cannot live without you as part of my life.
Nov 24, 2014, 9:41 PM - Yashmitha: I'm sorry that off late it's been a busy schedule for me & you don't feel important but you are. I wouldn't say it otherwise.
Nov 24, 2014, 9:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You wouldn't say what re?

Nov 24, 2014, 9:44 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah like Thaaaat it's going
Nov 24, 2014, 9:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The roof is somewhere and all
Nov 24, 2014, 9:56 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly. One baby made it 😂😂
Nov 24, 2014, 10:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Shoo. See the down part. So perfect.

Nov 25, 2014, 7:06 AM - Yashmitha: 🙈
Nov 25, 2014, 7:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Aye! Don't make fun.
Nov 25, 2014, 7:45 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I spent the night researching Berkeley okay? It's sooo scary! Half of them are Indians but they're all from IIT. And they're so accomplished its hard to bring myself to even apply!
Nov 25, 2014, 7:53 AM - Yashmitha: Bub. Give it a shot. 😕
Nov 25, 2014, 7:54 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You know most forms are orientated towards the PhD degree? That's what makes me feel so inferior.
Nov 25, 2014, 7:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: At least I hope that's the reason they're like that.
Nov 25, 2014, 7:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Publications, presentations, awards, grants, research experience, they're all separate sections and I have nothing to put in any of them.
Nov 25, 2014, 8:03 AM - Yashmitha: Oh! Yeah bubby. They're looking for PhD students mostly even I heard
Nov 25, 2014, 8:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the problem in most places.
Nov 25, 2014, 8:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I strongly feel like I won't make it this year. Maybe at Stanford and CMU but the others are doubtful. Obviously that's not a bad thing though. 😝

Dec 1, 2014, 9:15 PM - Yashmitha: Good evening everyone 
I'm Yashmitha Ravindra President of the Rotaract club of Bangalore Kalyan 
Okay so the club is about 11 years old now. We're basically the youth wing of the Rotary. It was chartered by the daughter of Lochana Aunty.. We have about 30 members now & we do a lot of fun activities to help the community.. Like BDC & Art competitions for kids & health camps and all of that. Besides this the Rotaract is a good platform to meet & get to know youth from our community
It's open to everyone above the age of 18. And we hope that some of you would be interested in joining us. If so please contact either me or Nishith after the program. You can also encourage friends to join because we're having fun while we're doing good work

Dec 10, 2014, 7:44 AM - Yashmitha: Relax
Dec 10, 2014, 7:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Even the weekend would've been ample time
Dec 10, 2014, 7:44 AM - Yashmitha: Don't think about it. Have they seen the final version?

Dec 10, 2014, 7:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We decided that my start was too abrupt and very random.
Dec 10, 2014, 7:50 AM - Yashmitha: So sweet of them Bubb!

Dec 11, 2014, 4:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hey
Dec 11, 2014, 5:00 PM - Yashmitha: I might not get 20/50 in process control. Which means I'm not eligible. Means I have to withdraw.
Dec 11, 2014, 5:00 PM - Yashmitha: Means suppli.
Dec 11, 2014, 5:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Really sweetie?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:00 PM - Yashmitha: How bad is my life
Dec 11, 2014, 5:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How's that possible?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What happened?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You didn't go and ask for some grace?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:01 PM - Yashmitha: I got single digits in the first two tests. Could get 30 in the third but I panicked so much.
Dec 11, 2014, 5:01 PM - Yashmitha: And it's Swami. He doesn't give more than 8 in assignments out of twenty.
Dec 11, 2014, 5:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the cie scheme?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:02 PM - Yashmitha: What grace?? Nonsense 
He doesn't even give what you deserve.
Dec 11, 2014, 5:02 PM - Yashmitha: 30 from two internals. 20 from assignments
Dec 11, 2014, 5:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He did this to everyone re?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:03 PM - Yashmitha: Mostly
Dec 11, 2014, 5:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: High single digits means you get above 20 anyway no? Fingers crossed <<<>>>
Dec 11, 2014, 5:03 PM - Yashmitha: Fingers crossed but mostly I'll withdraw. Thu. Should I still go ahead with applying to MS?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One subject, which I'm guessing is not relevant to your ms course
Dec 11, 2014, 5:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can explain it in your sop
Dec 11, 2014, 5:05 PM - Yashmitha: Do I have to? Since I'm applying now, the subject is 7th sem
Dec 11, 2014, 5:05 PM - Yashmitha: So it's not gonna be there on my transcript
Dec 11, 2014, 5:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They'll ask for your transcript after you're admitted no sweetu?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:06 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know. Will they?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:07 PM - Yashmitha: You mean when we're there?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re, after admission also they'll ask you to send transcripts
Dec 11, 2014, 5:13 PM - Yashmitha: Are you serious?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:13 PM - Yashmitha: Shit
Dec 11, 2014, 5:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think it's that way, I'll check
Dec 11, 2014, 5:14 PM - Yashmitha: No re. No one else said that 😕
Dec 11, 2014, 5:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Obviously you'll have to send them your final degree no?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *show
Dec 11, 2014, 5:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some cases they give provisional admission and ask for transcripts
Dec 11, 2014, 5:23 PM - Yashmitha: Oh..
Dec 11, 2014, 5:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some cases they don't, and expect the final transcript once it arrives at the end of engineering
Dec 11, 2014, 5:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I dono if every place does it but sweetu
Dec 11, 2014, 5:23 PM - Yashmitha: Ohh..
Dec 11, 2014, 5:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Michigan mentioned the provisional,
Dec 11, 2014, 5:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Stanford didn't
Dec 11, 2014, 5:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But both places need a guarantee that you've got your degree
Dec 11, 2014, 5:25 PM - Yashmitha: Obviously. That's different no re?
Dec 11, 2014, 5:26 PM - Yashmitha: That I can send later no?

Dec 11, 2014, 5:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay see, I don't think the grade matters as long as you clear the course
Dec 11, 2014, 5:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And if you show that you've done amazingly well in everything else
Dec 11, 2014, 5:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you get C, C, D, E, D, F

Dec 11, 2014, 5:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But if you get A, A, S, W, A it doesn't seem bad at all!
Dec 11, 2014, 5:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not like India where youre not even eligible for something if you don't have perfect marks and cutoff
Dec 11, 2014, 5:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There you'll get looked at at least
Dec 11, 2014, 5:35 PM - Yashmitha: I won't get all that. It'll be S, B, W, A, A, S, A, B, B

Dec 11, 2014, 5:36 PM - Yashmitha: 7.75 is dysfunction
Dec 11, 2014, 5:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're above that
Dec 11, 2014, 5:36 PM - Yashmitha: *distinction

Dec 12, 2014, 9:27 PM - Yashmitha: Bub, this is little simple no? It's okay?
Dec 12, 2014, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it's better no? The language makes it longer.
Dec 12, 2014, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me how it sounds.
Dec 12, 2014, 10:05 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm. Okay bub. Let tiny one see 😄

Dec 12, 2014, 11:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not even helping me re 😞
Dec 12, 2014, 11:35 PM - Yashmitha: I swear, I really don't know what to do! You should always ask someone who's as good as you or better, dumbo!
Dec 12, 2014, 11:35 PM - Yashmitha: Why do I ask you?
Dec 12, 2014, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You should read, and tell me if it convinces you re..
Dec 12, 2014, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not asking you to tell me whether the subject and the verb agree or whether I've used passive voice and all 😞
Dec 12, 2014, 11:40 PM - Yashmitha: I told you I didn't really like it bub.. I don't know, I have weird tastes no? I like stuff that's very flowery.. Stuff that has a personal touch. This one's really technical
Dec 12, 2014, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I bought something cool today ☺
Dec 12, 2014, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It needs to be sweetu.. I tried very hard to make it that way
Dec 12, 2014, 11:40 PM - Yashmitha: What you bought off cutie?
Dec 12, 2014, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You need to show your intelligence, your awareness of the subject
Dec 12, 2014, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It means everything, it makes a world of a difference. It's called an academic sop no? They need to see enough academics shine through
Dec 12, 2014, 11:41 PM - Yashmitha: Oh! Okay. I thought it should be like a story. Aiyyo.
Dec 12, 2014, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll show you when I get it 😁

Dec 28, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *yeah 
You don't get me though.. I care about you, I love you regardless of anything else.. It sucks to have to constantly be made to feel stupid or desperate
Dec 28, 2014, 6:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I really can't go on like this..
Dec 28, 2014, 6:21 PM - Yashmitha: Sonal, what do you think you're gonna get out of this? 😕
Dec 28, 2014, 6:21 PM - Yashmitha: You really want to end up getting hurt?
Dec 28, 2014, 6:22 PM - Yashmitha: It's not like I don't care or I don't like you anymore or something. If you think I'd come over if I didn't, you must be stupid
Dec 28, 2014, 6:23 PM - Yashmitha: I don't think I can deal with someone overly attached when I can't put myself together in the first place

Dec 28, 2014, 6:24 PM - Yashmitha: You are.. What do you want? Us to get back together?
Dec 28, 2014, 6:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think I'm overly attached.. How much time do I spend on you? I don't even talk to you till you talk to me
Dec 28, 2014, 6:32 PM - Yashmitha: You are.. You still have feelings for me, don't you?
Dec 28, 2014, 6:32 PM - Yashmitha: It's been more than a year
Dec 28, 2014, 6:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Of course.. I've always told you that
Dec 28, 2014, 6:33 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah.. How's that helping? I've always told you I can't.. You get upset if I say no to you, you get upset if I come there & we don't get physical.. What am I supposed to do?
Dec 28, 2014, 8:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Next time you ask me for anything and I do it for you or give it to you or whatever, please keep in mind that it's because I have feelings for you.
Dec 28, 2014, 8:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm never going to stop giving, till I stop loving.. And if you want to take advantage of that, go ahead.. If not,  don't.. It's upto you

Jan 16, 7:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know re.. This makeup thing is making me think twice about everything 😣 they haven't announced dates also. You know sometimes, they'll ask you to register today and have the test the day after?
Jan 16, 7:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's crazy 😞
Jan 16, 7:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why I get stuck like this?

Jan 17, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And it generated quite a bit of interest among panelists and others present

Jan 17, 8:49 PM - Yashmitha: Sweetheart! Relax! Why are you so scared??
Jan 17, 8:49 PM - Yashmitha: You're sure you don't want to apply to any place safe?
Jan 17, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I know it's a challenge.. I feel like I'm not good enough
Jan 17, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sure I don't want to study at some place safe
Jan 17, 8:50 PM - Yashmitha: I think Maryland is safe for you no?
Jan 17, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think the investment is justified
Jan 17, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re, people apply there coz it's so cheap
Jan 17, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Almost everyone applies.. It's like texas price.
Jan 17, 8:50 PM - Yashmitha: Ohh! You should have applied for TAMU
Jan 17, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Same thing Chutki.. Everyone applies there
Jan 17, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And they don't do the work I'm interested in
Jan 17, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh

Jan 17, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: I want Rutgers also.
Jan 17, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: 😛
Jan 17, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: First you finish applying
Jan 17, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: I want good grades in college!
Jan 17, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Yeah
Jan 17, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Rutgers you'll definitely get!
Jan 17, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: I hope so too!
Jan 17, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: I wish I had done one more project. Few online courses
Jan 17, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: And gpa at least 8.5 😕
Jan 17, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what? I mean it, you have a realistic shot at these colleges
Jan 17, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not like my situation
Jan 17, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know you're skeptical about that, but it's true..
Jan 17, 11:13 PM - Yashmitha: I love you for this. And for every little thing you do for someone like me!
Jan 17, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're only little <>
Jan 17, 11:15 PM - Yashmitha: 😘

Jan 17, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: Do they make offers till seats fill up?
Jan 17, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: Most people don't even take it
Jan 17, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They make more offers than there are sears
Jan 17, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Always
Jan 17, 11:20 PM - Yashmitha: Oh!
Jan 17, 11:20 PM - Yashmitha: What if everyone accepts? 😳
Jan 17, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think it's a calculated risk
Jan 17, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But everyone won't accept
Jan 17, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or everyone may not get visa, or be able to afford education there
Jan 17, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Lots of pitfalls along the way
Jan 17, 11:21 PM - Yashmitha: I don't think tamu does that Bub
Jan 17, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Every place does that re
Jan 17, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: People have different priorities
Jan 17, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some care about the cost, others about location, job prospects, proximity to home, ranking
Jan 17, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: True that. Look at you for example
Jan 17, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If someone has a choice between more than one, TAMU may not be their choice
Jan 17, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like they
Jan 17, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *That
Jan 17, 11:23 PM - Yashmitha: You're one smarty. So much you think off
Jan 17, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki!

Jan 17, 11:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some EC girl got into UMass and Dallas already
Jan 17, 11:30 PM - Yashmitha: Dallas even Deepti's friend got off
Jan 17, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Jan 17, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's partly why I'm bothered
Jan 17, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: Relax bubba
Jan 17, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: Only few places have started
Jan 17, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: Those places you would get even without applying 😛
Jan 17, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww?

Jan 18, 6:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was going to say that, but then, you'll beat me no?
Jan 18, 6:37 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jan 18, 6:37 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah if you say it it's wrong 😝
Jan 18, 7:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think we lost IITK
Jan 18, 7:56 PM - Yashmitha: Are you sure??
Jan 18, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes
Jan 18, 8:51 PM - Yashmitha: Shit. How many places were there??
Jan 18, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just one
Jan 18, 8:56 PM - Yashmitha: Damn 😕
Jan 18, 8:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay re 😊
Jan 18, 8:56 PM - Yashmitha: You'll had high chances of winning??
Jan 18, 8:57 PM - Yashmitha: Bubba you know something.. I'm really upset 😕
Jan 18, 8:57 PM - Yashmitha: Tamu admits only 25 students a year 😕
Jan 18, 8:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wasn't at the event, but pai said we had a good shot
Jan 18, 8:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You listen to me okay? The money does not matter. It's only right in the beginning that you need it, for the visa
Jan 18, 8:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But after that you'll go there and find that you can do a lot to cut back on costs!
Jan 18, 8:59 PM - Yashmitha: Huh? No! I really wanted TAMU! It's an awesome university bubba!
Jan 18, 8:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The money that you spend will come back in spades! You don't worry 😘
Jan 18, 8:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know re, I know about awesome universities no?
Jan 18, 8:59 PM - Yashmitha: I know sweetie.. I'm just paranoid 😕

Jan 18, 9:00 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe.. Brb bubba. Dinner
Jan 18, 9:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now we can't do anything except will this to happen
Jan 18, 9:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hope and pray
Jan 18, 9:23 PM - Yashmitha: But I haven't really applied no bubba.. That's why I'm thinking if I should 😕
Jan 18, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Means what?
Jan 18, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why wouldn't you apply??
Jan 18, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you, they stress on the whole application, not just one part of it
Jan 18, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you're strong enough in the other areas, it papers over the weaknesses
Jan 18, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: Do a lot of people apply to north Carolina? 😋
Jan 18, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes they do
Jan 18, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: NCSU is a nice place
Jan 18, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: You're serious?? 😕
Jan 18, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Coz of the weather and the cost and the opportunities
Jan 18, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: Shit! I thought no one applies!
Jan 18, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: Oh god be with me! 😞
Jan 18, 9:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki you can't think like that!
Jan 18, 9:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not like you'll find a place where five people apply
Jan 18, 9:27 PM - Yashmitha: Shit 😞
Jan 18, 9:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you want that, then the only sure thing is North Dakota or Wyoming or something!
Jan 18, 9:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're being scared for no reason :/
Jan 18, 9:27 PM - Yashmitha: Can you please ask that Rutgers guy where all he applied & where he got Bub? Please 😞
Jan 18, 9:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The reason people apply to about 5-6 places is this only re
Jan 18, 9:28 PM - Yashmitha: 😞
Jan 18, 9:28 PM - Yashmitha: Ask no, love?
Jan 18, 9:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll talk to him directly sweetu?
Jan 18, 9:36 PM - Yashmitha: Okay. He's approachable?
Jan 18, 9:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't know re..

Jan 18, 9:44 PM - Yashmitha: Chemical engineering is ranked really low here
Jan 18, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: See?
Jan 18, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'vs to think of job prospects also
Jan 18, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If it's ranked low, won't it be a struggle later on?
Jan 18, 9:45 PM - Yashmitha: Hmmmm. Bubba NCSU is ranked 20!
Jan 18, 9:46 PM - Yashmitha: I didn't know it was THAT good, I thought it would be safe
Jan 18, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You finish your exam and come tomorrow, we'll talk
Jan 18, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're making this more complicated than it is
Jan 18, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: Okay 😞
Jan 18, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: NCSU is a place in demand because of various reasons. People think it's gettable and it has a good location and weather and cost and stuff
Jan 18, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: I need to get in somewhere! 😕
Jan 18, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The course itself may not be good, but there's no way of saying that toll you sift through all of their material on the site. Research, endowment, strength and so on
Jan 18, 9:51 PM - Yashmitha: I really can't understand anything you know? 😞
Jan 18, 9:51 PM - Yashmitha: Need to start from scratch!
Jan 18, 9:51 PM - Yashmitha: Okay I'll come meet you tomorrow okay?

Jan 19, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's his problem re?
Jan 19, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's he saying?
Jan 19, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: He's not even picking up when I call him 😕
Jan 19, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Screw him.. Just find a teacher in college
Jan 19, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Any teacher will do
Jan 19, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If he comes through later, you can give his name. For the time being put that other name down and go with it
Jan 19, 10:30 PM - Yashmitha: But his recommendations are of worth no? 😞
Jan 19, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They are sweetu.. But you know what?
Jan 19, 10:31 PM - Yashmitha: Okay 😕
Jan 19, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you have a professor who's taught for a period greater than or equal to 2 years?
Jan 19, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That would be better
Jan 19, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah, I'll ask someone in college re
Jan 19, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If that person is willing to lie and say he/she has known you for that long, it's even better
Jan 19, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah all my teachers have said they've known me for three years
Jan 19, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's known you for a year right? And you haven't done anything with a result under him? Nothing that they can look at and say "Oh she's done good work here"
Jan 19, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a good recommendation, but it has limitations.. And we don't know what he'll say also
Jan 19, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: True that. I'll find my petro teacher to write. Hehe

Jan 22, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: I have reason to be..
Jan 22, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki, you please apply to 6-8 places. And properly, before deadlines.
Jan 22, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know you'll get in.
Jan 22, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not possible that someone from dayanand sagar, under VTU, has amazing GPA and stuff.
Jan 22, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Neither is it possible that he has amazing internships or research experience. People end up in those colleges for a reason..
Jan 22, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: I'm scared Bubb 😞
Jan 22, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm telling you sweetie, you please do your bit
Jan 22, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm annoyed that you haven't finished
Jan 22, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't mess with deadlines, under any circumstances
Jan 22, 11:14 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah re. Doing now
Jan 22, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Keep doing.. You'll be fine! I assure you!
Jan 22, 11:18 PM - Yashmitha: I will no?
Jan 22, 11:19 PM - Yashmitha: Because this Deepti & all are also applying to these places re..
Jan 22, 11:19 PM - Yashmitha: So the competition is so high
Jan 22, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All of them? All the places?
Jan 22, 11:20 PM - Yashmitha: Except Texas tech & NCSU
Jan 22, 11:20 PM - Yashmitha: Tamu also. They're applying to chemical
Jan 22, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll get. The odds of not getting are way too low
Jan 22, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just because they're applying doesn't mean you shouldn't no?
Jan 22, 11:21 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah 😐
Jan 22, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are they better than you? On paper?
Jan 22, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think so.. their sop is extremely superficial from what I've seen. The recommendations are clearly hard to believe. Professors in India don't write like that 
Who knows what they'll think of such things?
Jan 22, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: Mrunal has 9.1, similar internships & project & papers & gre 310 
Deepti has 8.5, gre 310, no papers, one internship, one project
Jan 22, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're better than Deepti then no?
Jan 22, 11:23 PM - Yashmitha: I'm 8 re 😐
Jan 22, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm applying to an entirely different department!
Jan 22, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you sweetie, it's not just about one thing!
Jan 22, 11:24 PM - Yashmitha: You my dear, are incomparably awesome. I cannot tell you how amazing you are. No one else I know has shown your sort of learning ability & interest
Jan 22, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's about who you are, what you say, all that
Jan 22, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Compare your sop with theirs..
Jan 22, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do they mention why chemical? Why MS? What in MS? Future goals?
Jan 22, 11:26 PM - Yashmitha: Not particularly..
Jan 22, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How everything you've included helps qualify you as a good candidate for the course?
Jan 22, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think yours is convincing. Let them be the judge of that. But for that to happen you've to apply.
Jan 22, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And not whenever you feel like.
Jan 22, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If they have rolling admission, apply early!

Jan 23, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I love you! Don't freak out, don't apply to the not so nice places, you're much better them!

Feb 6, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes, it's not even your fault that you don't get admitted. There just may not be a good fit. At least in the places I've applied to, this matters a lot
Feb 6, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So a candidate might get rejected over something that's not even a fault
Feb 6, 11:46 PM - Yashmitha: Fingers crossed bubba.. Sigh
Feb 6, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe because the candidate didn't choose that aspect well enough

Feb 17, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what CMU did?

Feb 17, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And those people were obviously very happy.

Feb 17, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're up sweetie pie?
Feb 17, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I just had a new idea
Feb 17, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How does doorstep tailoring sound?
Feb 17, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You get to look tailors up. Maybe a catalog?
Feb 17, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And then if you want, you can have the tailor, or some expert come over and do measurements
Feb 17, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The tailor will finish and supply. Clothes can be dropped off for free.
Feb 17, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: That's an area no one has ventured into! Awesome.
Feb 17, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: But it's highly sensitive Bub
Feb 17, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why?
Feb 17, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: Tailoring is very sensitive. People get really mad when tailors ruin it
Feb 17, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, so how do you find tailors?
Feb 17, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe we can do our groundwork and pick tailors appropriately?
Feb 17, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe there can be a screening?
Feb 17, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm. It'll be a lot of work to do. But I think you can do it.

Feb 18, 5:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Binary Boss - I just unlocked the title Binary Boss playing Tech on #QuizUp https://www.quizup.com/en/topics/it-web-tech/title?player_id=312442047497932244&level=20&source=share
Feb 18, 5:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was bored :P
Feb 18, 5:03 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂
Feb 18, 5:03 PM - Yashmitha: Clearly
Feb 18, 6:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So mean.
Feb 18, 6:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're a bummy. Go.
Feb 18, 6:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what? CMU usually forwards applications to departments where you might fit.
Feb 18, 6:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's an option you can check while filling the application out. I don't know when they do that. Right in the beginning, or now.
Feb 18, 6:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think I might get some information science or something
Feb 18, 6:25 PM - Yashmitha: Really?
Feb 18, 6:25 PM - Yashmitha: Oh..
Feb 18, 6:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Basically just some weird degree that doesn't mean much
Feb 18, 6:25 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm..
Feb 18, 6:26 PM - Yashmitha: You can still take it up if you get it
Feb 18, 6:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re.. Some degrees are just meant for the college to make money off you
Feb 18, 6:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like the MIS thing everyone applies for.
Feb 18, 6:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The ones without marks that want to go abroad
Feb 18, 6:26 PM - Yashmitha: Ohh
Feb 18, 6:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't see what sort of work it equips you for
Feb 18, 6:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: MIMS Program | UC Berkeley School of Information - http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims

Feb 18, 6:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah!

Feb 18, 6:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummy. What you've been upto?
Feb 18, 6:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought really hard about this startup thing okay? If we build something solid, and I'm sure we're halfway there with the idea, the possibilities are endless. We'll have the first mover advantage, coz no one's thinking about this. And we can build a more and more comprehensive suite of Financial Services.
Feb 18, 6:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I have some really nice ideas for it that can be executed through funding and hiring.
Feb 18, 6:33 PM - Yashmitha: Which girl Bub? Which portal?

Feb 18, 6:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Feb 18, 6:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This one. There's no option to send you something via message in this stupid new Facebook app :/
Feb 18, 6:38 PM - Yashmitha: Lol hundreds of groups are there with that name
Feb 18, 6:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh

Feb 18, 11:43 PM - Yashmitha: 😘
Feb 18, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😘
Feb 18, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Arvind is being annoying re.. I want to go to Bhubaneswar but I don't think he wants to
Feb 18, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He keeps changing his mind
Feb 18, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This always happens.
Feb 18, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then about 2-3 days before we're priced out of flights
Feb 18, 11:47 PM - Yashmitha: He's limiting you really
Feb 18, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's sick.
Feb 18, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's the one that told me about this quiz in the first place.
Feb 18, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not even like I found it and am forcing him to come.
Feb 18, 11:48 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. He's unreliable
Feb 18, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told him to tell me if he doesn't want to go.
Feb 18, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Damn annoyed.
Feb 18, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was snapping at people this morning. Woke up to the news of Berkeley so I was in a bad state.
Feb 18, 11:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I'm fine now 😁
Feb 18, 11:56 PM - Yashmitha: Oh bubba
Feb 18, 11:56 PM - Yashmitha: I was upset the whole day coz of that too!
Feb 18, 11:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww?
Feb 18, 11:56 PM - Yashmitha: Possibly more than you were 😝
Feb 18, 11:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay re.. I probably didn't belong in a research environment anyway.
Feb 18, 11:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The more I think about it, the more it's reaffirmed in my mind
Feb 18, 11:56 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm
Feb 18, 11:57 PM - Yashmitha: Bubba listen
Feb 18, 11:57 PM - Yashmitha: I'm damn sleepy
Feb 18, 11:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to break my back over research while people are out there making money and living life :/
Feb 18, 11:57 PM - Yashmitha: You are fickle minded.
Feb 18, 11:58 PM - Yashmitha: I'll talk to you about this soon.
Feb 18, 11:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not fickle re..
Feb 18, 11:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Honestly, I feel like it didn't happen for me coz I'm destined for something better
Feb 18, 11:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've always insisted that I want something of my own
Feb 18, 11:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If I can have it already, then what's my problem?
Feb 19, 12:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night pumpkin! Thank you for everything ❤
Feb 19, 12:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sharma didn't get Princeton re
Feb 19, 1:43 PM - Yashmitha: I still want you to get an MS so that you don't regret it later In life. It obviously means a lot if you've studied at UCB irrespective of what you're studying.. Please just listen to me 😕
Feb 19, 1:45 PM - Yashmitha: Oh? 😕
Feb 19, 1:45 PM - Yashmitha: What do they even look for.. Nonsense 😞
Feb 19, 1:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He had everything re
Feb 19, 1:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Except papers, everything
Feb 19, 1:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Too strange
Feb 19, 2:01 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly.. 😕
Feb 19, 2:01 PM - Yashmitha: They really shouldn't expect papers from BE students. It brings down research quality 😕
Feb 19, 2:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you mean?
Feb 19, 2:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They're the best in the world no? They'll get people who will do research
Feb 19, 2:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what the incentive is? Research leads to patents and products. And that's how they earn money. Companies come and ask them to work. Any intellectual product that is created while working on something in the University is their property. Or at least gives them stake in the product.
Feb 19, 2:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Those are the sort of people they'd prefer if given an option.
Feb 19, 2:10 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm.. So much competition
Feb 19, 2:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah.
Feb 19, 2:10 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Feb 19, 2:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How was your day Chutki?

Feb 19, 2:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At 4
Feb 19, 2:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I'm going there
Feb 19, 2:12 PM - Yashmitha: Okay. All the best.. Make it happen
Feb 19, 2:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😁
Feb 19, 2:12 PM - Yashmitha: Pai doesn't simply choose partners
Feb 19, 2:12 PM - Yashmitha: Make sure you make best use of the opportunity
Feb 19, 2:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know re
Feb 19, 2:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I have 50% stake in this as a co-founder.
Feb 19, 2:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And I really really need this to work out.
Feb 19, 2:13 PM - Yashmitha: That's brilliant. All the more reason to make it happen
Feb 19, 2:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Remember I told you I'll ask Arvind once and for all about Bhubaneswar?
Feb 19, 2:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I did, last night. But he didn't reply. Yet.
Feb 19, 2:13 PM - Yashmitha: Make sure everything is on paper & certified. These people are the ones that use talent & take advantage. Be very careful
Feb 19, 2:14 PM - Yashmitha: Let it be then. Concentrate on finalytics
Feb 19, 2:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know re.. But it's okay, he won't do that. I can tell by the way he behaves. I've seen how it is with others.
Feb 19, 2:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I deserve to know no? Why is he being like that? It's not like we have some issues or something?
Feb 19, 2:15 PM - Yashmitha: Arvind is so weird really
Feb 19, 2:16 PM - Yashmitha: You can't go with tiny one?
Feb 19, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No chance
Feb 19, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No cross college teams allowed.
Feb 19, 2:16 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Feb 19, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And she's not good at this stuff. Technology.
Feb 19, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, she can't leave home and go anywhere.
Feb 19, 2:17 PM - Yashmitha: How much is the prize money?
Feb 19, 2:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 1L
Feb 19, 2:37 PM - Yashmitha: Then why the fuck is he not willing to go??
Feb 19, 2:38 PM - Yashmitha: Ask him if he has issues with you 😕
Feb 19, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Leave it. I'll deal with it <>
Feb 19, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's really pissing off.
Feb 19, 2:43 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Feb 19, 2:43 PM - Yashmitha: Not a single big quiz together..
Feb 19, 3:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah

Feb 21, 3:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm making that face.
Feb 21, 3:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You should know.
Feb 21, 3:26 PM - Yashmitha: 😂
Feb 21, 3:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Peaceful it seems 😒
Feb 21, 3:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some hippie you think you are. Bummy.
Feb 21, 3:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not a hippie and all. You're just a bummy. Don't get confused.
Feb 21, 3:27 PM - Yashmitha: I'm too cool for life
Feb 21, 3:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Pat pat pat. See?
Feb 21, 3:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummy.
Feb 21, 3:28 PM - Yashmitha: 😂
Feb 21, 3:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're one crazy person!
Feb 21, 3:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Want to come by car?
Feb 21, 3:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like driving
Feb 21, 3:29 PM - Yashmitha: Waste shit!

Feb 21, 3:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll bring your bike and meet me there? How do you want to do this?
Feb 21, 3:31 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm. Come to my bus stop place only. We'll get ice cream on the way & go off. Can we go on a long drive?
Feb 21, 3:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes
Feb 21, 3:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll leave now?

Feb 21, 7:34 PM - Yashmitha: 😒
Feb 21, 8:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Scared of the spanking huh?
Feb 21, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Feb 21, 8:47 PM - Yashmitha: Send photos 😒

Feb 21, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Come take selfie while you're driving it seems.
Feb 21, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only you can ask for such stuff.
Feb 21, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummiest person ever.
Feb 21, 9:06 PM - Yashmitha: Bummiest? 😕
Feb 21, 9:06 PM - Yashmitha: There's only one Bummy!
Feb 21, 9:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh, you want to be unique and all?
Feb 21, 9:07 PM - Yashmitha: Very much 😋
Feb 21, 9:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oho
Feb 21, 9:07 PM - Yashmitha: I'll text later Bubb.

Feb 21, 9:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't tell me Nicholas Sparks
Feb 21, 9:08 PM - Yashmitha: Paulo Coelho's book actually

Feb 21, 9:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, have fun
Feb 21, 9:09 PM - Yashmitha: 😋
Feb 21, 9:09 PM - Yashmitha: Good night bubba :*
Feb 21, 9:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Eh*
Feb 21, 9:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Since when did 9pm become good night? 😯
Feb 21, 9:10 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo.
Feb 21, 9:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chill chill ✌
Feb 21, 9:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Peaceful. 😂
Feb 21, 9:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Was this like a date missy? :P
Feb 21, 9:12 PM - Yashmitha: Bubba. 😕 Please don't make me think so much 😕
Feb 21, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aiyyo
Feb 21, 9:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay fine
Feb 21, 9:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night
Feb 21, 9:17 PM - Yashmitha: But I did have a nice time with you. I'm at ease with myself around you except for when I think we're alone. I start getting edgy then 😕
Feb 21, 9:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't understand why
Feb 21, 9:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the matter re?
Feb 21, 9:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What am I going to do? You don't have to feel guilty about anything
Feb 21, 9:20 PM - Yashmitha: I really don't know. 😕
Feb 21, 9:20 PM - Yashmitha: I'm too fucked up like that.
Feb 21, 9:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's all in your mind sweetie..
Feb 21, 9:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Remember in the beginning, how you were afraid of being with me?
Feb 21, 9:21 PM - Yashmitha: I know what I'm doing Bub. I just cannot explain it to you.
Feb 21, 9:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me no?
Feb 21, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: No. I really can't explain these things even to myself 😅
Feb 21, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not ready to jump into anything right now 😕
Feb 21, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just let me hold you, there's going to be no need for explanation 😊
Feb 21, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing you've to think about. Nothing.
Feb 21, 9:23 PM - Yashmitha: No Bub. I can't be close physically really.
Feb 21, 9:23 PM - Yashmitha: I really feel weird.
Feb 21, 9:23 PM - Yashmitha: Awkward. Something.
Feb 21, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Did something happen?
Feb 21, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How do you know you'll feel awkward?
Feb 21, 9:24 PM - Yashmitha: I feel awkward at the thought only. 😕
Feb 21, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Haven't I always respected you? Physically at least? If I make you feel awkward, then I don't know what to say..
Feb 21, 9:24 PM - Yashmitha: This is not your fault!
Feb 21, 9:24 PM - Yashmitha: Just stop irritating me like that!
Feb 21, 9:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Let me make it better :)
Feb 21, 9:25 PM - Yashmitha: Go man.
Feb 21, 9:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
Feb 21, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: I told you it's not your fault. So irritating.
Feb 21, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fine.
Feb 21, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Feb 21, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chill, it's fine.
Feb 21, 9:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But let's not pretend then. When I say something it's very real for me. I actually imagine or feel it.
Feb 21, 9:28 PM - Yashmitha: Gimme some time. I'll let you know if I feel sane enough.
Feb 21, 9:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're sane enough. I don't want you to undermine yourself. You always do that. Please remember that.
Feb 21, 9:29 PM - Yashmitha: Not right now. I can't explain to you how fucked up everything is for me. I need the space.
Feb 21, 9:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay!
Feb 21, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not going anywhere :P
Feb 21, 9:30 PM - Yashmitha: Okay. But don't push me too much.
Feb 21, 9:30 PM - Yashmitha: I'll go now
Feb 21, 9:30 PM - Yashmitha: Good night, sweet dreams
Feb 21, 9:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night
Feb 21, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Manchester keeps losing re!
Feb 21, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😢
Feb 21, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You didn't feel like running that girls marathon?
Feb 22, 5:04 AM - Yashmitha: Lol. Crop me out properly from the picture. It looks funny
Feb 22, 6:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Leave it 😋
Feb 22, 6:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Aaaayyy! That's the picture I clicked no? 😁
Feb 22, 6:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Today I dreamt that at Utexas, I thought I got in coz of the way the email was worded but I didn't actually get through 😢
Feb 22, 9:06 AM - Yashmitha: Shoooo. Stop thinking that way!
Feb 22, 9:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh.. Every night has been about bad dreams
Feb 22, 9:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And worst of all, I remember all of them
Feb 22, 9:10 AM - Yashmitha: Drink milk before you sleep. It aids in getting sweet dreams :)
Feb 22, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want dudu :P
Feb 22, 9:10 AM - Yashmitha: 😒
Feb 22, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😂
Feb 22, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't help it okay? I'm talking to you. 😒
Feb 22, 9:11 AM - Yashmitha: Go man. Stupid thing.
Feb 22, 9:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😞
Feb 22, 9:12 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what? Arvind is just a big drunk..
Feb 22, 9:11 AM - Yashmitha: Bubba the shimoga riot scene is three days old. Can you verify & tell?
Feb 22, 9:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Let me see
Feb 22, 9:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He drinks,  every single night! During the day also, if he can help it.
Feb 22, 9:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Says he spends about 8k a month
Feb 22, 9:14 AM - Yashmitha: Oh. Where does he get the money from if he doesn't quiz?
Feb 22, 9:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He has enough re
Feb 22, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's sick. I had so much hope for this sem.
Feb 22, 9:17 AM - Yashmitha: I know 😕
Feb 22, 9:18 AM - Yashmitha: I've always told you. You don't depend on him. Be better than him. Then you can go with even Aanchal & win 😋
Feb 22, 9:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't do this without a team.
Feb 22, 9:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You actually can't. I can get to finals, but after that, in order to actually win, in a place like bangalore where you get half decent competion, it's very hard
Feb 22, 9:19 AM - Yashmitha: Hmmmm.. Why doesn't he care anymore?
Feb 22, 9:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: When I was a little kid, I used to think "Oh, life's been good. I don't understand why people say it's tough or competitive or hard. I'm doing pretty well. That can't change"
Feb 22, 9:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It was such a cloistered opinion though.
Feb 22, 9:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I was so naïve :P
Feb 22, 9:20 AM - Yashmitha: The world will never stop being competitive.
Feb 22, 9:21 AM - Yashmitha: There's competition in every little thing 😋
Feb 22, 9:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I remember how my mom used to say that when I grow up, one day I won't have enough time to get everything done, and I'll be begging for more time
Feb 22, 9:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And I just wouldn't believe
Feb 22, 9:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I know! There's competition for you also!
Feb 22, 9:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😝
Feb 22, 9:22 AM - Yashmitha: 😂😂 There isn't. I'm just a lost cause 😋
Feb 22, 9:22 AM - Yashmitha: Brb Bub
Feb 22, 9:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No no, you're not 😊
Feb 22, 9:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I looked up Shimoga, couldn't find anything
Feb 22, 9:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can you check with your contact there?
Feb 22, 9:27 AM - Yashmitha: Okay Bub. I will.
Feb 22, 10:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Aye, you're free to message now?
Feb 22, 10:51 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm feeling very philosophical 😝
Feb 22, 10:56 AM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂
Feb 22, 10:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😢
Feb 22, 10:56 AM - Yashmitha: Tell me, Socrates
Feb 22, 10:56 AM - Yashmitha: What be on your mind?
Feb 22, 10:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Wait, it's damn lame :P
Feb 22, 10:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll simply laugh at me. 😒
Feb 22, 10:58 AM - Yashmitha: Tell me anyway 😋
Feb 22, 10:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How conscious do you normally feel?
Feb 22, 10:59 AM - Yashmitha: About?
Feb 22, 11:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Have you had those days when you didn't care what you looked like, what others thought about you?
Feb 22, 11:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Days when you just wanted to get through?
Feb 22, 11:01 AM - Yashmitha: I always care what impression I'm making
Feb 22, 11:02 AM - Yashmitha: How I look is correlative to how I feel. Not the other way round.
Feb 22, 11:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Feb 22, 11:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: For me it's so different. Taking care of myself, trying to look good or whatever is only possible if I feel good on the inside
Feb 22, 11:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you always feel like you have a purpose? Sometimes, I don't. And it makes me feel like shit
Feb 22, 11:04 AM - Yashmitha: That's true for most people. But usually when I dress up for college, it's because I don't feel good. So I try to look good & feel good that way 😋
Feb 22, 11:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you ever dress up for me? 😋
Feb 22, 11:05 AM - Yashmitha: Hehe. I do 😋
Feb 22, 11:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😁
Some people, go their entire lives without having any objectives re.. I don't know how they do it
Feb 22, 11:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm at a sort of doldrums.. I don't know what exactly to do with myself.
Feb 22, 11:07 AM - Sonal Saldanha: People like my mom and all, intellectually, they don't do anything.. I don't know how to do that. To not put your mind to use.. To use your mind just to do run of the mill, every day chores and stuff
Feb 22, 11:07 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's such a waste no?
Feb 22, 11:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Even when I'm talking, I'm thinking about how to surprise or impress or amuse someone. When I wake up, I try to figure out why I dreamt what I dreamt. When I'm walking, I'm trying to figure out who the person I'm looking at is, or what must go on in their lives.
Feb 22, 11:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: My mind is so messed up no?
Feb 22, 11:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You're bored already no? 😝
Feb 22, 11:12 AM - Yashmitha: It's true. I keep telling my mom not to be idle even if staying at home doesn't mean being idle. But that generation was like that. You won't find much of that type anymore. Like we spoke about, the world has become top competitive. One can't survive if they aren't doing their best every single day.
Feb 22, 11:13 AM - Yashmitha: Allowing your mind to think & plan all the time is the only way to keep track of what you need to do & what you're doing. It's so important to reflect. Every single day.
Feb 22, 11:14 AM - Yashmitha: Otherwise when you wake up suddenly, reality will hit top hard.
Feb 22, 11:14 AM - Yashmitha: Things will be out of control.
Feb 22, 11:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's so overwhelming but. You should be inaide my mind at some point.
Feb 22, 11:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I wonder if they'll ever create something like that
Feb 22, 11:14 AM - Yashmitha: Either you should deal with whatever life throws at you, or you should take control of your life.
Feb 22, 11:15 AM - Yashmitha: It's not. You're doing well. Don't let your brain idle, you're not meant to be that way.
Feb 22, 11:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I think it'll be like a paradise 😋
Feb 22, 11:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No? If my mind were a place, it'd be like Belize.
Feb 22, 11:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And it'd be like the Matterhorn.
Feb 22, 11:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It'd be like the Dead Sea, and like Manhattan.
Feb 22, 11:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No?
Feb 22, 11:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The best places ever 😝
Feb 22, 11:16 AM - Yashmitha: Mine would be like Bangalore. So chaotic. Seems like things are getting done, but nothing is 😋
Feb 22, 11:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing gets done in bangalore missy :P
Feb 22, 11:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing looks like it'll get done also :P
Feb 22, 11:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you dream of me?
Feb 22, 11:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I hope I don't become a drunk like Arvind someday :/
Feb 22, 11:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It upsets me. Collehe is over. I'll never be able to do this again!
Feb 22, 11:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He'll go to some bschool and continue this shit
Feb 22, 11:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't make it on your own. Nothing is possible on your own sweetheart. I used to believe it was, but it really isn't.
Feb 22, 11:21 AM - Yashmitha: I feel really bad for you. I wish he would be reasonable!
Feb 22, 11:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's one of the reasons I adore you. It's a release for me, being around you, being able to talk to frankly.
Feb 22, 11:23 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No one ever sees this side of me. Not even when I'm drunk with others and everyone's spilling their guts out about their deepest darkest secrets
Feb 22, 11:24 AM - Yashmitha: I'm very special 😋
Feb 22, 11:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes yes. But you can't say that.
Feb 22, 11:24 AM - Yashmitha: I like listening to you. Your thoughts are intense!
Feb 22, 11:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You shouldn't. It's bad manners :P
Feb 22, 11:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I like talking to you coz you listen 😊
Everyone complains that I say very little no?
Feb 22, 11:25 AM - Yashmitha: Shoooo. Hello. 
And you're like Christian Grey 😏
Feb 22, 11:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How would they feel if I spoke like this?
Feb 22, 11:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I haven't read that book so I don't know what to think of that :P
Feb 22, 11:26 AM - Yashmitha: They won't listen. Not everyone can listen.
Feb 22, 11:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm destined to make very few connections with purple that I can actually talk to.
Feb 22, 11:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: *people
Feb 22, 11:27 AM - Yashmitha: It's alright. But you need more people than just one 😝
Feb 22, 11:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm.
Feb 22, 11:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've never met a guy I can talk to.
Feb 22, 11:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Not like this.
Feb 22, 11:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Only the girls are willing to listen :P
Feb 22, 11:28 AM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂
Feb 22, 11:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But if they're not sufficiently complicated, I don't like them :P
Feb 22, 11:28 AM - Yashmitha: They're just looking at you, thinking of how you're cute. Tryst me 😝
Feb 22, 11:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Not complicated, at least having sophisticated thoughts and reasoning
Feb 22, 11:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm still cute? Am I cuter now than before?
Feb 22, 11:30 AM - Yashmitha: Now you're too thin! Be chubby!
Feb 22, 11:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Chubby or bulky?
Feb 22, 11:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I lost weight coz of malaria no?
Feb 22, 11:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Haven't put on since.
Feb 22, 11:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Whatever I put on was all muscle mass
Feb 22, 11:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: About 5kgs of it
Feb 22, 11:33 AM - Yashmitha: Be chubby. Hehe.
Feb 22, 11:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Like you?
Feb 22, 11:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😁
Feb 22, 11:35 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But I like you. I've always been physically attracted to you. 😘
Feb 22, 11:35 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah.
Feb 22, 11:35 AM - Yashmitha: 😁
Feb 22, 11:36 AM - Yashmitha: Haha. I know 😝
Feb 22, 11:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You aren't no?
Feb 22, 11:36 AM - Yashmitha: I am too. I'm attracted to myself.
Feb 22, 11:37 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😒
You aren't attracted to me?
Feb 22, 11:37 AM - Yashmitha: Bubba. Do you have extra Samsung charger?
Feb 22, 11:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Feb 22, 11:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No re, I don't have mom's one broke so she took.
Feb 22, 11:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If I asked you to come here with me, would you?
Feb 22, 11:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Check this out on Flipkart! - http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/samsung-etaou10ibe3m-battery-charger/p/itme3vpaqgkhhs6s?pid=ACCE3VPASEZZXTTF

Feb 24, 7:19 PM - Yashmitha: Stanford no scope.. Especially since Berkeley rejected
Feb 24, 7:19 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm?
Feb 24, 7:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My CS angle was that I've worked on robotics hardware and now I want to do software
Feb 24, 7:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why I picked AI, and AI planning.
Feb 24, 7:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because the project I did, and competitions I took part in also were with regard to those concepts only
Feb 24, 7:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Any other branch or area of CS, it's very hard to convince. Coz i have nothing to show only
Feb 24, 7:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Wisconsin didn't list AI
Feb 24, 7:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Stanford is less of the academics and more practical application re.. Maybe. Just maybe.
Feb 24, 7:21 PM - Yashmitha: I really hope Bub.. Like really
Feb 24, 7:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But sometimes I think,  I just want to work on this finalytics business and be financially independent by the time I'm 25*
Feb 24, 7:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Two - three is what it takes.
Feb 24, 7:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At most.
Feb 24, 7:22 PM - Yashmitha: Why's there a star above 25? Conditions apply? 😂
Feb 24, 7:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Companies come up, become profitable, usually get bought out.

Feb 24, 7:23 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Dear & all 😝
Feb 24, 7:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I won't have to take all that debt on, I would've built something from scratch, and any business degree I want, I can walk into
Feb 24, 7:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I have the firsthand experience
Feb 24, 7:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm thinking that should be my alternative. Because after all, my goal is to make something that I can call my own right? If I can do it right away, without the financial pressure, ably supported by someone who can bring in the funding and other such resources, it'd be stupid not to take it up..
Feb 24, 7:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No?
Feb 24, 7:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Does that make sense to you my dear? 😘
Feb 24, 7:25 PM - Yashmitha: That's true. But after two years I want you to get an ivy league degree.
Feb 24, 7:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe not two, but definitely at some point.

Feb 25, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: Nonsense?
Feb 25, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: I talk to you the most.
Feb 25, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh.. I'm just really frustrated re
Feb 25, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sorry
Feb 25, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can you Skype?
Feb 25, 10:02 PM - Yashmitha: About what??
Feb 25, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: About my complicated life
Feb 25, 10:02 PM - Yashmitha: And bubba I'm really tired. I can't Skype 😕
Feb 25, 10:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've no idea how much is going wrong for me..
Feb 25, 10:04 PM - Yashmitha: Can we just talk over the phone?
Feb 25, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sure
Feb 25, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not going to call obviously? 😝
Feb 25, 10:06 PM - Yashmitha: Wait. Fool.
Feb 25, 10:16 PM - Yashmitha: Give few minutes
Feb 25, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Take.
Feb 25, 10:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Done 😊
Feb 25, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sorry that wasn't for you :P
Feb 25, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: Oho. Then? Who did you do? 😜
Feb 25, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who did I do?
Feb 25, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I did you. In my mind.
Feb 25, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ☺
Feb 25, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: Lecherous creature 😜
Feb 25, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You shut up.
Feb 25, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why you don't get it?
Feb 25, 10:23 PM - Yashmitha: I don't 😋
Feb 25, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's not to get?
Feb 25, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: For you?
Feb 25, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: Me 😋
Feb 25, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Feb 25, 10:27 PM - Yashmitha: 😝
Feb 25, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh
Feb 25, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: I really don't think you should be trying do hard 😕
Feb 25, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: It'll just guilt me!
Feb 25, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you think I know what I want?
Feb 25, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do I do things on a whim?
Feb 25, 10:34 PM - Yashmitha: Not really. You know what you want. But you don't do things without thinking
Feb 25, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can I speak frankly missy?
Feb 25, 10:37 PM - Yashmitha: Yes you can. Always.
Feb 25, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All I want right now, is to hold you and go to sleep. I want this because you're familiar and you're nice and you care for me. Because we have a nice time together and it's always fun. But me wanting that doesn't mean I'm asking you to commit to me for life. It could never be like that and I know it :/ 
I want us to live in the moment and not in apprehension of the future or fear of the past.
Feb 25, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We've been through so much, but back then, we could never do justice to what we had in the way we hoped. Too many restrictions. Parents, money, time, my mindset. But things are different now. You know it's not the same. No?
Feb 25, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: You're making so much sense. But I'm really not sure if I should commit to something.
Feb 25, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: It's hard to get out of it.
Feb 25, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We won't be near each other for very much longer re..
Feb 25, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: You never know
Feb 25, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hush.. What's that supposed to mean?
Feb 25, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: If you get Stanford & I get something there too , we'll be around!
Feb 25, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Please. It's not called being around.  We'll be 500-600 miles apart at the very least re 😂
Feb 25, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is that going to work? No its not.. Not in a country where we neither have the time to travel nor the money
Feb 25, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I got cold feet when I had to go to Calcutta itself re 😝
Feb 25, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂
Feb 25, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: You're one funny!
Feb 25, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: But see. If I commit to something I have to give my best
Feb 25, 10:49 PM - Yashmitha: Right now I really can't 😞
Feb 25, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay?
Feb 25, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you mean?
Feb 25, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: I have to meet. Call. Text. Etc.
Feb 25, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Gone. No scope.
Feb 25, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meet me when you can. I'm free virtually every afternoon. There's no expectations
Feb 25, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Calling, even I can't do. I prefer Skype :P
Feb 25, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it's not like there needs to be a timetable no?
Feb 25, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's silly
Feb 25, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And if you text, I try very hard not to reply :P I can't spend 49p on one tiny little message 😂
Feb 25, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm also going to be quite busy with my own thing missy. Got to make something of my life before the end of the sem 😝
Feb 25, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've seen no? I barely call or text or ask to meet
Feb 25, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: I'm trying that re. Really hard to.
Feb 25, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah I know
Feb 25, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So please, forget about me having any expectations
Feb 25, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've learnt that that's not how all this works :P
Feb 25, 11:00 PM - Yashmitha: Does this require me to be physical with you? 😝
Feb 25, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are we signing a contract and putting everything down?
Feb 25, 11:01 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂
Feb 25, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "this requires you to give yourself to me atleast once a month. Twice every alternate month." 
Bummy. What shit you ask.
Feb 25, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Feb 25, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: Fuck that's so funny 😂
Feb 25, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😒
Feb 25, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes I wonder what goes on in that mind.
Feb 25, 11:04 PM - Yashmitha: It's one mushy puddle 😋
Feb 25, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: Awwwww!
Feb 25, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: I'll be hobbes 😋
Feb 25, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But then you'll be bigger than me!
Feb 25, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And you'll be imaginary also!
Feb 25, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Waaaaaa
Feb 25, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: I'm imaginary only.
Feb 25, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: I'm a ghost. Booooo.
Feb 25, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like that only sometimes. I'll be sending some 20 messages and get 1 reply 😝
Feb 25, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay listen, tomorrow I've a meeting in malleshwaram at 10
Feb 25, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you going to college?
Feb 25, 11:14 PM - Yashmitha: Some twenty people text at once means what I'll do?
Feb 25, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought I could come there and wait till about 9:30, then leave.
Feb 25, 11:14 PM - Yashmitha: I'm going a 12 Bub
Feb 25, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Feb 25, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't want to ride through all the traffic
Feb 25, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm. Okay, I'll figure it out.
Feb 25, 11:15 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo 😞
Feb 25, 11:15 PM - Yashmitha: I have project at 2 so I'm going
Feb 25, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've stopped taking public transport. Bike is sooo much cheaper! 300 rupees, 230km or so.
Feb 25, 11:18 PM - Yashmitha: Book looks amazing!
Feb 25, 11:18 PM - Yashmitha: And yes. Public transport is absolute rip off. And annoying.
Feb 25, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You want? I actually wanted to go trade it in blossoms
Feb 25, 11:19 PM - Yashmitha: Not really. I want LOTR
Feb 25, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's too boring!
Feb 25, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fantasy fiction is very hard to read.
Feb 25, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Half those names will be gibberish coz the characters are supposed to be from a strange land.
Feb 25, 11:21 PM - Yashmitha: I want to read though
Feb 25, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm. Arvind should have. You should ask him 😊
Feb 25, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He'll probably have the box set.
Feb 25, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He collects all this sort of stuff.
Feb 25, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Peanuts, Calvin & Hobbes, LOTR, TinTin
Feb 25, 11:23 PM - Yashmitha: Then he won't give 😋
Feb 25, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He'll give man. Tell him you're not Tiwari, that you'll return.

Feb 26, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then he retired and started writing.
Feb 26, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He teaches at IISc and at IIMB.
Feb 26, 2:21 PM - Yashmitha: That's crazy! You guys are getting him to help?
Feb 26, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now he started a startup called Cimplyfive.
Feb 26, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For company compliance.
Feb 26, 2:22 PM - Yashmitha: Ohh!
Feb 26, 2:22 PM - Yashmitha: Are you gonna be part of it?
Feb 26, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's going to mentor us with our own thing
Feb 26, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So we were using him as a sounding board to see if the idea will hold up in th market
Feb 26, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He was skeptical and gave us some alternative things to think about
Feb 26, 2:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So we might pivot and do something slightly different to ensure we capture more of the market
Feb 26, 2:23 PM - Yashmitha: Oh 😕
Feb 26, 2:23 PM - Yashmitha: Okay!
Feb 26, 2:23 PM - Yashmitha: Good luck. I really want you to go ahead & be awesome.
Feb 26, 2:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay re, it's a good thing. I liked what he had to say. It made sense to me.

Feb 26, 2:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do something chemical related no?
Feb 26, 2:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Market and sell something?
Feb 26, 2:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's easy
Feb 26, 2:26 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Think about It. He knows a lot of smart people but he chose you. How amazing are you? :)
Feb 26, 2:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what re? There are very few people that are willing to try something like this. Like that Shruti rhijwani girl. She could've done this but she didn't.
Feb 26, 2:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I actually wasn't his first pick, but it worked out :P
Feb 26, 2:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Visa is coming for placement. I like how big they are.
Feb 26, 2:35 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Who was his first pick?
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Rhijwani
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Yashmitha: She could have done what?
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Yashmitha: Oh okay. Lol
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's asked me before also, like second year and all.
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I didn't show interest :/
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I should've no?
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Yashmitha: Stop regretting anything. Fool.
Feb 26, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even with the startup festival, he wanted me to be part of it. But I kept brushing him off
Feb 26, 2:38 PM - Yashmitha: It's okay. Just make sure you make money.
Feb 26, 2:38 PM - Yashmitha: Lol
Feb 26, 2:39 PM - Yashmitha: If there's something I can do, tell me & I'll help so that I can make pocket money 😝
Feb 26, 2:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In the US, Visa pays people $100k
Feb 26, 2:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Here they intend to pay $10k

Feb 26, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like when I get ignored like that 😞
Feb 26, 2:43 PM - Yashmitha: Oh. They're afraid of you doing well!
Feb 26, 2:43 PM - Yashmitha: Because you're really good. They won't show it but they're jealous.

Feb 26, 2:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And college is too boring re. I can't take it!
Feb 26, 2:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My relationship with everyone is pretty much nonexistent.
Feb 26, 2:44 PM - Yashmitha: You'll never find company that loves you. They'll all be competitors! You have to never stop being amazing!
Feb 26, 2:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: With Arvind, he ruined it
Feb 26, 2:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: With aanchal, she's too worried about Sharma going abroad to care about anyone else
Feb 26, 2:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mojo irritates like this
Feb 26, 2:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Manika, it's awkward :P
Feb 26, 2:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So it's pretty bad :P
Feb 26, 2:45 PM - Yashmitha: Your face is awkward. She's really nice to you!

Feb 26, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't have to loot anyone. Just use this as motivation to succeed :)
Feb 26, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know something? The greatest people, the richest and most powerful, they grew from nothing. And they grew because they had nothing.
Feb 26, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All they had was the desire to change their lives, that's what you also need re
Feb 26, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not academic performance or marks or anything. It's the will and the desire to get ahead no matter what.
Feb 26, 11:40 PM - Yashmitha: I need this Bub. Like really need it.
Feb 26, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So work for it!
Feb 26, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't say you'll loot people and all. You know why? Because despite doing all that, you know the money was never yours.. It's a different feeling when you own it re :&
Feb 26, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :)
Feb 26, 11:42 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. So true. 
And I was kidding 😋
Feb 26, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want that for you, I always have 😘 you know that no?
Feb 26, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've always pushed you to work hard and do more and be more independent
Feb 26, 11:45 PM - Yashmitha: I love you too much for that.
Feb 26, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm <>
Feb 26, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can get there, but only if you realise that you've to work to get there
Feb 26, 11:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't wait for people to hand stuff out to you.. Coz it'll never happen. Maybe once in a lifetime. But it's not something to be counted upon. No?
Feb 26, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki, if I was going from an idea stage to something concrete?
Feb 26, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly. I haven't been on the right track of late.
Feb 26, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like a plan or something?
Feb 26, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What could I call the process of transitioning?
Feb 26, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some nice word?
Feb 26, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: From something abstract to something real?
Feb 26, 11:51 PM - Yashmitha: All I can think of is butterflies 😋
Feb 26, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why?
Feb 26, 11:53 PM - Yashmitha: Coz they transform like that. From caterpillars.
Feb 26, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But they're still real re

Feb 26, 11:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought of condense
Feb 26, 11:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like Vapor to liquid.
Feb 26, 11:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But pai doesn't like it much
Feb 26, 11:57 PM - Yashmitha: Oh.
Feb 26, 11:58 PM - Yashmitha: I can't think of something like that,
Feb 27, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you think of deskter?
Feb 27, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Like dexter
Feb 27, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But a fusion of desk and dexter
Feb 27, 12:03 AM - Yashmitha: Makes no sense only to me
Feb 27, 12:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The site does something smart
Feb 27, 12:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: So dexter, like a reference to the cartoon
Feb 27, 12:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Too farfetched?
Feb 27, 12:07 AM - Yashmitha: No one will get it
Feb 27, 12:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm.. But names don't always suggest what they do no re?
Feb 27, 12:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Like Starbucks, or chrome or motorola
Feb 27, 12:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It has to be explained
Feb 27, 12:13 AM - Yashmitha: Oho. Major fellow you are 😋
Feb 27, 12:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😝
Feb 27, 12:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to bite you.
Feb 27, 12:18 AM - Yashmitha: Shit. I think I'm in trouble 😑
Feb 27, 12:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Eh?

Feb 27, 12:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me no? :/
Feb 27, 12:23 AM - Yashmitha: This guy from Rotaract. He's funny so we text & all. Suddenly it changed to flirting. And now I think he thinks I'm serious. Gonna have to block him :P
Feb 27, 12:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You flirted back? You don't even flirt with me 😒
Feb 27, 12:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Bad idea to be texting anyone at this hour if you don't want to mislead them :¿
Feb 27, 12:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: :P
Feb 27, 12:26 AM - Yashmitha: I know. Shit.

Feb 27, 12:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki I feel different re! Remember how I would've gotten so angry at all this earlier?
Feb 27, 12:27 AM - Yashmitha: I don't say anything & you want to eat me all the time. I say something & gone 😝
Feb 27, 12:28 AM - Yashmitha: Lol. Yeah
Feb 27, 12:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Say no?
Feb 27, 12:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You never want to eat me no?
Feb 27, 12:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😞
Feb 27, 12:29 AM - Yashmitha: You're not like pudding only 😝
Feb 27, 12:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Who's this guy but?
Feb 27, 12:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You only like pudding?
Feb 27, 12:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You like meat no?

Feb 27, 12:39 AM - Yashmitha: Lol. I occasionally flirt with all the ones I'm close to. The ones that know I'm kidding.
Feb 27, 12:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Except me 😝
Feb 27, 12:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I know you're not kidding?
Feb 27, 12:40 AM - Yashmitha: Because I don't want you to get hopeful.
Feb 27, 12:40 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Feb 27, 12:40 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh..
Feb 27, 12:41 AM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Or if you wish, I could flirt. But you should promise that you won't get hopeful
Feb 27, 12:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Again with the contracts..
Feb 27, 12:42 AM - Yashmitha: 😝
Feb 27, 12:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can you get straight with me and tell me what's going on here?
Feb 27, 12:45 AM - Yashmitha: What's going on??
Feb 27, 12:45 AM - Sonal Saldanha: With us..
Feb 27, 12:45 AM - Yashmitha: I don't know!
Feb 27, 12:45 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Is anything going on?
Feb 27, 12:46 AM - Yashmitha: What you're asking??
Feb 27, 12:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you remember our discussion from last night?
Feb 27, 12:47 AM - Yashmitha: 😑
Feb 27, 12:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Wth is that?
Feb 27, 12:48 AM - Yashmitha: I don't have answers because my answers aren't what you want to hear.
Feb 27, 12:48 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You didn't sound like this yesterday..
Feb 27, 12:49 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Seriously, are you just messing with me?
Feb 27, 12:49 AM - Yashmitha: Listen. I wouldn't do that.
Feb 27, 12:49 AM - Yashmitha: 😑
Feb 27, 12:49 AM - Yashmitha: So irritating
Feb 27, 12:49 AM - Yashmitha: I already told you I have issues with this
Feb 27, 12:50 AM - Yashmitha: Simply you'll assume something & then say I lead you on
Feb 27, 12:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Didn't I ask you yesterday?
Feb 27, 12:50 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Didn't you say yes?
Feb 27, 12:50 AM - Yashmitha: I said I'll date you?
Feb 27, 12:50 AM - Yashmitha: Wtf??
Feb 27, 12:51 AM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Feb 27, 12:52 AM - Yashmitha: Okay listen I'll fall asleep now
Feb 27, 12:52 AM - Yashmitha: So I'll reply later
Feb 27, 12:52 AM - Sonal Saldanha: This is getting so out of hand.. Seriously re.. I told you What's on my mind yesterday. And you had apprehensions. I told you what I think about those also. Then you didn't really say anything so I just assumed
Feb 27, 12:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want you back.. I know it's going to work. You're afraid, but really there's no reason to be :/
Feb 27, 12:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Shit.. This sucks 😞
Feb 27, 12:56 AM - Yashmitha: I'm sorry if I made you hopeful
Feb 27, 12:56 AM - Yashmitha: 😕
Feb 27, 12:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Wth?
Feb 27, 12:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me what can possibly go wrong?
Feb 27, 12:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you afraid of being happy? Because happiness is all this is about for me. It's not about the money. It's not some sort of peer pressure, 'girlfriend is a sign of a social stature' thing either..
Feb 27, 12:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Please don't say one thing at one time and then the next day pretend like nothing ever happened. That's really cruel.
Feb 27, 7:40 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Listen, you have class today?
Feb 27, 7:40 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Going?
Feb 27, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-oxytocin-alcohol-20150224-story.html
Feb 27, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ❤
Feb 27, 3:07 PM - Yashmitha: Chummu. Hi
Feb 27, 3:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki.
Feb 27, 3:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *nods*
Feb 27, 3:08 PM - Yashmitha: Yes I had college. Were you there?
Feb 27, 3:08 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Ohhh.
Feb 27, 3:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was in college. Now I'm waiting for a quiz to start in RV.
Feb 27, 3:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I almost died today 😐
Feb 27, 3:10 PM - Yashmitha: Ohoo. Meet Shruti 😛
Feb 27, 3:10 PM - Yashmitha: Wtf??
Feb 27, 3:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No chance.
Feb 27, 3:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to meet her and all.
Feb 27, 3:10 PM - Yashmitha: Why not? 😛
Feb 27, 3:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't irritate.
Feb 27, 3:11 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Feb 27, 3:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's over. I hate her..
Feb 27, 3:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's usually the way it goes no? :P
Feb 27, 3:11 PM - Yashmitha: Hahaha 😝
Feb 27, 3:12 PM - Yashmitha: I guess.
Feb 27, 3:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
Feb 27, 3:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can we talk about us? You always run off :P
Feb 27, 3:13 PM - Yashmitha: I stopped thinking about it re
Feb 27, 3:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Stopped thinking about what?
Feb 27, 3:13 PM - Yashmitha: I like us just the way we are
Feb 27, 3:14 PM - Yashmitha: I don't want more & I don't want to ruin what we have either
Feb 27, 3:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay. if I met you now, for the first time, and started to get to know you?
Feb 27, 3:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Would you start to really like me? Enough to want to be with?
Feb 27, 3:15 PM - Yashmitha: Hahaha! How are you supposed to think of someone you've known for 6 years that way??
Feb 27, 3:16 PM - Yashmitha: I know you too well!
Feb 27, 3:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What I'm trying to say, is that all your fears are misplaced! You're making arguments out of fear.. But there's no need for it. :/ 
You know what I'm like, how I'll never do anything to cause you harm
Feb 27, 3:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I like us the way we are too! We're basically saying everything we would even if we were officially together.. Just that you haven't really said we are
Feb 27, 3:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like it's some sort of trick.. :/
Feb 27, 3:18 PM - Yashmitha: I know!! You're too good for me. I'm not as good as you think 😝
Feb 27, 3:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Look, that would only be a problem if I started thinking that way.
Feb 27, 3:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This is not placement missy! You can't say, "Oh you're too good for our company, we can't hire you"
Feb 27, 3:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Facepalm :P
Feb 27, 3:19 PM - Yashmitha: Shoooo. Nonsense you are. Why can't we just be friends?? 😛
Feb 27, 3:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Have I said anything to deliberately make you feel inferior?
Feb 27, 3:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I really really really want you. Because I want to be happy for once! Like really happy.
Feb 27, 3:20 PM - Yashmitha: Not like that. I can't promise loyalty because I'm not the same anymore. That's unfair 😛
Feb 27, 3:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What sort of loyalty are you talking about?
Feb 27, 3:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's unfair?
Feb 27, 3:21 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. I've grown too comfortable with everyone giving me attention & I gladly take it. Commitment scares me now 😕
Feb 27, 3:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You think you can be "loyal" to shayak or whoever else you like but not to me? That doesn't make any sense :/
Feb 27, 3:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Did I tell you to change who you are? If you know that I like you and I know that you like me back, it's good enough for me
Feb 27, 3:21 PM - Yashmitha: Brb lunch
Feb 27, 3:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I do enough of the same thing you're talking about :P
Feb 27, 3:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd never refuse a compliment or whatever no? I've always been like that. I've made my peace with it :P
Feb 27, 3:33 PM - Yashmitha: Not compliment. Lol. It's far worse. I don't want to really reveal that side :P
Feb 27, 3:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Huh?
Feb 27, 3:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're keeping stuff from me?
Feb 27, 3:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Will you please just tell me like it is?
Feb 27, 3:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the worst you've done?
Feb 27, 3:35 PM - Yashmitha: I have commitment issues re. Because the last time I did that, it was so hard to break off.
Feb 27, 3:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Feb 27, 3:35 PM - Yashmitha: I don't want to get hurt or hurt. Which is inevitable. I'm settling for arranged marriage. 😝
Feb 27, 3:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why would that even matter? I told you, we won't be around only!
Feb 27, 3:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's no way around that!
Feb 27, 3:36 PM - Yashmitha: What shit? I might not even go. Even you might not. 😕
Feb 27, 3:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We won't even be in the same state.
Feb 27, 3:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're going. Why won't you go?
Feb 27, 3:36 PM - Yashmitha: Because I won't get any acceptances..
Feb 27, 3:37 PM - Yashmitha: Not this year 😕
Feb 27, 3:37 PM - Yashmitha: I really don't want to think that but I don't know if I'll get anything..
Feb 27, 3:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know you will.. Trust me
Feb 27, 3:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Listen re, I just want to have the best time I've ever had. I know I'll get that with you.
Feb 27, 3:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's my singular reason behind being with you. I told you its not about peer pressure or neediness or anything.
Feb 27, 3:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <>
Feb 27, 3:41 PM - Yashmitha: How about we do all of that, like hang out & sweet text but without dating? :P
Feb 27, 3:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because then it'll only be texting and occasionally talking.
Feb 27, 3:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll still have to hear you put me in my place constantly.
Feb 27, 3:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "Oh you're my ex. Oh we're not together." That sort of stuff.
Feb 27, 3:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Have I really been wrong about much? You should trust me about this!
Feb 27, 3:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, being around someone is because you want to, not because you're contractually obliged to and all. No? I think we have a good enough time for you to want to spend time with me
Feb 27, 3:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what being together means. You want to be around someone coz of the way you feel with them.
Feb 27, 3:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Quiz prelim. Gimme fifteen minutes. 
Meanwhile please tell me what you think. And please take a leap of faith. You won't regret it 😉
Feb 27, 4:05 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo.. 😑
Feb 27, 5:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
Feb 27, 6:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're choosing to ignore my messages now?
Feb 27, 6:21 PM - Yashmitha: I don't have anything to say right away..
Feb 27, 6:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Did you even read all that I said?
Feb 27, 6:22 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah man. I did
Feb 27, 6:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Cool.
Feb 27, 6:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Will you be meeting me tomorrow?
Feb 27, 6:43 PM - Yashmitha: Tomorrow Bub? Afternoon is fine? I have to go for A Rotaract event in the evening
Feb 27, 6:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Going to a bar. You'll come no?
Feb 27, 6:59 PM - Yashmitha: Bar with whom?
Feb 27, 7:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: College maybe. If not, by myself :P
Feb 27, 7:01 PM - Yashmitha: Lol why yourself? Waste.
Feb 27, 7:01 PM - Yashmitha: Okay if possible I'll come.
Feb 27, 7:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because friends are overrated and unreliable.
Feb 27, 7:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Terribly so.
Feb 27, 7:06 PM - Yashmitha: Nonsense.
Feb 27, 7:07 PM - Yashmitha: I've always had you having my back irrespective of the issues we face.
Feb 27, 7:07 PM - Yashmitha: It's true for you too.
Feb 27, 7:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to face issues. I just want to bite you 😝
Feb 27, 7:08 PM - Yashmitha: 😂
Feb 27, 7:08 PM - Yashmitha: Hopeless. Just hopeless 🙈😂
Feb 27, 7:08 PM - Yashmitha: I feel like pudding. Soft. Bitable.

Feb 27, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't be such a bummy.
Feb 27, 7:32 PM - Yashmitha: I have to live up to bumminess 😋
Feb 27, 7:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll bite you!
Feb 27, 7:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh.. I feel so helpless! :P
Feb 27, 7:45 PM - Yashmitha: You're one helpless Bummy
Feb 27, 8:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Made some money today.

Feb 27, 8:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't so charity and all.
Feb 27, 8:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: On the other hand, if I were on a date? Then maybe 😝
Feb 27, 8:26 PM - Yashmitha: Lol.  😝
Feb 27, 8:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're too irritating re :/
Feb 27, 8:39 PM - Yashmitha: I was gonna say something. Gouda called in between
Feb 27, 8:40 PM - Yashmitha: Sorry 😕
Feb 27, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Feb 27, 8:51 PM - Yashmitha: But yeah. Sheh. Why are you tempting me with free food? 😝
Feb 27, 8:51 PM - Yashmitha: Severe weaknesses!
Feb 27, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm
Feb 27, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay listen, don't I even deserve a chance?
Feb 27, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you so hate being with me like that, then cut it out. But give me a chance.
Feb 27, 8:53 PM - Yashmitha: Don't get emo. Really stop. This isn't about you not deserving me. That puts me above you. I'm clearly not.
Feb 27, 8:53 PM - Yashmitha: I don't want you to think that way. Really.
Feb 27, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not being emo.
Feb 27, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Really re, you should stop seeing this as a win or lose for someone.
Feb 27, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's not on my mind. It's never been.
Feb 27, 8:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If I like someone, I like someone. That's all.
Feb 27, 8:55 PM - Yashmitha: Fuck. Is there anything that'll convince you to stop trying?? 😕
Feb 27, 8:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is there some other reason you're saying no?
Feb 27, 8:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is there someone else?
Feb 27, 8:58 PM - Yashmitha: There isn't!
Feb 27, 8:58 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not even trying. I don't want commitment at this point.
Feb 27, 8:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ...
Feb 27, 9:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're behaving as though it's like taking on an assignment that's extremely difficult. Like there's so much to do..
Feb 27, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: As I'm talking to you, I'm starting to feel really really sorry for. Myself..
Feb 27, 9:02 PM - Yashmitha: You just want reason to hate?
Feb 27, 9:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Reason to hate what?
Feb 27, 9:03 PM - Yashmitha: Me. Fool.
Feb 27, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I gave aanchal 50 rupees today, I made 50 times the amount!
Feb 27, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So cool no?
Feb 27, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How am I hating you

Feb 27, 9:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Come tomorrow.

Feb 27, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Feb 27, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm
Feb 27, 9:28 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. What time? I have college till 1
Feb 27, 9:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then after that obviously
Feb 27, 9:30 PM - Yashmitha: Okay Bub. I'll let you know if I can come. Because I'm not sure if I'll take my bike 😕
Feb 27, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Feb 27, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If not?
Feb 27, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't take bike, take bus or something
Feb 27, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you come toward majestic I can come
Feb 27, 9:31 PM - Yashmitha: But if I don't take the bike, I'll come home & then come. So that I can chill with you & then go for Rotaract
Feb 27, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We should go for a movie
Feb 27, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: Tomorrow it'll be expensive
Feb 27, 9:50 PM - Yashmitha: I wanna watch 50 shades
Feb 27, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah
Back to forum value mall? :P
Feb 27, 9:50 PM - Yashmitha: Why so far?
Feb 27, 9:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like old times 😝
Feb 27, 9:51 PM - Yashmitha: What old times?
Feb 27, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't remember forum value mall?
Feb 27, 9:52 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Feb 27, 9:52 PM - Yashmitha: We went once I think?
Feb 27, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. Syrem
Feb 27, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Surem
Feb 27, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Such a bitch.
Feb 27, 9:53 PM - Yashmitha: What??
Feb 27, 9:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You have no memories of forum value mall?
Feb 27, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or the theatre there?
Feb 27, 9:54 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. I do. Just pulling your leg :P I have the tickets.
Feb 27, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😞
Feb 27, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Will you be able to Skype?
Feb 27, 9:56 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Relax. I'll always cherish what we had! T
Feb 27, 9:56 PM - Yashmitha: First love for me 😛
Feb 27, 9:56 PM - Yashmitha: And no Bub. I'm not very fond of doing that so often.
Feb 27, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only love for me.. I've not had it before then or since
Feb 27, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know something? I'll always be guilty of how imperfect that was. Of how imperfect I was. That's partly why I want this back, so I can do things right :/
Feb 27, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want it to be perfect when I think about it..
Feb 27, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No hiding, no sneaking around, no struggling, no needless arguing, none of that :/
Feb 27, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: It's so much effort!!
Feb 27, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: I don't want! 😞
Feb 27, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't even get what you're calling effort re
Feb 27, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I honestly don't. I don't see what the effort is. For some reason in your mind, this is about hard work and all that. As though there are contractual obligations. It's really not like that you know? Maybe you felt like that coz of prior experiences, but that's not true.. See what I mean by how we need to set the record straight?
Feb 27, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I found out Navish has an MIT Skype interview today.
Feb 27, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :l
Feb 27, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He applied for MEng
Feb 27, 10:04 PM - Yashmitha: I don't want to date. I'm not in any state to.
Feb 27, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <>
Feb 27, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm really struggling..
Feb 27, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't think about anything else
Feb 27, 10:06 PM - Yashmitha: That's crazy Bub. Fuck. Imagine that feeling. How good is he??
Feb 27, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's not. It's MEng. There are no takers for it
Feb 27, 10:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You have to pay all the fees, there's no scholarship at all. You can't get RA/TA. And you never hear of anyone who's done this degree. None of the famous ones at least.
Feb 27, 10:08 PM - Yashmitha: Oh??
Feb 27, 10:08 PM - Yashmitha: I'd do any degree there 😝
Feb 27, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No point.
Feb 27, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm telling you no? Don't be like the average Indian!
Feb 27, 10:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're just being obsessed with that abbreviation. MIT. Just like people want to go to the U S of A.
Feb 27, 10:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't matter if it's Arkansas or the mines of North Dakota.
Feb 27, 10:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: As long as you go to amerika you're the boss.
Feb 27, 10:10 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂
Feb 27, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Missy? Would you kiss me?
Feb 27, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If there was a situation?
Feb 27, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :p
Feb 27, 10:12 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know. I'd hesitate
Feb 27, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Feb 27, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You shouldn't <>
Feb 27, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Life choices are too hard
Feb 27, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know something?
Feb 27, 10:13 PM - Yashmitha: It's not something surface level. Lol. 
Exactly!
Feb 27, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd actually have no problem walking away from this at this very moment
Feb 27, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's been long enough anyway.. I can make myself think that I shouldn't demean myself and all that
Feb 27, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I mean by asking and pleading so many times
Feb 27, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But somewhere deep down, I don't want to give up
Feb 27, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can never give something up when I know that's what I want
Feb 27, 10:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll always be bitter about it. Bitter that I didn't do well enough, that I didn't try hard enough :/
Feb 27, 10:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I still hate IITs and BITS and NITs :/
Feb 27, 10:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm going to hate CMU also forever
Feb 27, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to get back at rishika somehow.. I want to get back at annie
Feb 27, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And most of all, I want to get back at Shruti
Feb 27, 10:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You feel like coming to mysore with me?
Feb 27, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I always keep score.. I'm that sort of person.m
Feb 27, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: You're never going to be happy this way.
Feb 27, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: If you're still thinking about getting back at things so old. God help you.
Feb 27, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No,  it's just a way of remembering where I came from and what's formed me..
Feb 27, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But what I'm trying to say re, is that it works the other way also.. When I feel like I haven't done my best or something, I feel very guilty. I feel that way about college. About school. About you!
Feb 27, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: You're always bitter. Lol. Nothing formed you. Only academically it's a good thing.
Feb 27, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And I want to set those things right. Also..
Feb 27, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm so burdened no?
Feb 27, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You really should help me :P
Feb 27, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm actually full of shit :P
Feb 27, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: You're very stressed in life 😝
Feb 27, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Give one massagem
Feb 27, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: Shali gave me one in Goa okay? Like on the beach. Faaaaack it felt so good!
Feb 27, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You never let me do that to you 😒
Feb 27, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But seriously re, I don't know if I'll ever feel so strongly about someone
Feb 27, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I love you so much. I still love you so much. I wouldn't be here otherwise :P
Feb 27, 10:31 PM - Yashmitha: I have so many problems..
Feb 27, 10:31 PM - Yashmitha: You know something?
Feb 27, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: Part of why I fell for you is because I had to chase after you for SO long just to get you to talk to me! Forget dating 😝
Feb 27, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: I absolutely love that air.
Feb 27, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The attitude?
Feb 27, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: I told you no? Some Rotaract guy is trying to hit on me & I wanna block him because I don't like a guy who falls too easily.
Feb 27, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You told me re.
Feb 27, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: It fucking creeps me out.
Feb 27, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you feel like blocking me?
Feb 27, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd feel like blocking me. I think :P
Feb 27, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I think I still have really good timing and comic value. So that's a plus.
Feb 27, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No?
Feb 27, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I look damn nice. Want to see?
Feb 27, 10:34 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. That was what I found most attractive about you. The superiority air 😝
Feb 27, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now what you find attractive?
Feb 27, 10:36 PM - Yashmitha: Right now I'm very turned off by the way you're demeaning yourself really.
Feb 27, 10:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Feb 27, 10:37 PM - Yashmitha: Honestly.. It's very weak
Feb 27, 10:37 PM - Yashmitha: Although I know it's because you're very attached to me
Feb 27, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know. Buy you know something? I'm not ashamed. I'm not prostrating before someone that I think doesn't deserve it.
Feb 27, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In my mind you're worth it.
Feb 27, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And it's obvious, this isn't rebound, it isn't me getting bored or jealous or running out of options
Feb 27, 10:39 PM - Yashmitha: I'm touched.
Feb 27, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not flattering you re.. I'm just speaking out
Feb 27, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're one silly goose but somehow I like that!
Feb 27, 10:40 PM - Yashmitha: You don't see me for what I am though! Haha. I'm a complete mess right now. Still you like me
Feb 27, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've always been there no?
Feb 27, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And I've never been fazed.
Feb 27, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like who you're doing something for.
Feb 27, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *it's about
Feb 27, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you busy Chutki?
Feb 27, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Will you be able to talk?
Feb 27, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: Mrunal got UCSD
Feb 27, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Feb 27, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Did she even get rejected once? :/
Feb 27, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: No. 😣
Feb 27, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww re?
Feb 27, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You please don't worry till you get a response?
Feb 27, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That would be really really silly no?
Feb 27, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah but she's getting so many
Feb 27, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Does not matter re.
Feb 27, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All you need is one. More than one, it's just to show off. No?
Feb 27, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can you attend all? No.
Feb 27, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't let all this to get you down

Feb 27, 11:16 PM - Yashmitha: <>
Feb 27, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: Fuck I don't feel good
Feb 27, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: UCSD she got. Fuck.
Feb 27, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Listen re? Is it all about the name?
Feb 27, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you think every Stanford graduate succeeds?
Feb 27, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You make your own destiny. Please remember that sweetheart. You're in control, no matter where you are
Feb 27, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you choose to work hard and make something happen, it will certainly hapoen
Feb 27, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The first thing I want you to do is to stop believing that you're no good!
Feb 27, 11:19 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah..
Feb 27, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I have no problem doing that, why do you?
Feb 27, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You think my pleading is a turn off but what about your self confidence?

Feb 27, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But please start listening to me :P
Feb 27, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know what I'm saying, little at least :?
Feb 27, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :P
Feb 27, 11:24 PM - Yashmitha: Yes I will. Good night now
Feb 27, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night little one :)
Feb 28, 7:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Missy? You know food trucks?
Feb 28, 7:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Have you ever eaten from one?
Feb 28, 7:16 AM - Yashmitha: Oh you have the sauces! I was searching for them 😝
Feb 28, 7:16 AM - Yashmitha: And yes I have. The one in Khalli
Feb 28, 7:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What you have the sauces? Leave it in the car and go okay? 😒
Feb 28, 7:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh! There's one there? I didn't know. You don't take me only Bummy!
Feb 28, 7:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: One more big news. One guy in my class is going to Oxford :)
Feb 28, 7:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: So if mrunal worries you, imagine how I feel :P
There's always someone in a worse position than you are missy :P
Feb 28, 7:19 AM - Yashmitha: That's not the least bit comforting
Feb 28, 7:20 AM - Yashmitha: And It's disappointing that I can't even make it to colleges she's getting into
Feb 28, 7:20 AM - Yashmitha: And that's not even top universities
Feb 28, 7:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Did you even get responses? No. You didn't.
Feb 28, 7:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How can you say you didn't make it somewhere?
Feb 28, 7:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: UCSD is good for chem?
Feb 28, 7:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I know it's anxious times, I feel it too.. Imagine, I have 335. Everyone out there knows.
Feb 28, 7:21 AM - Yashmitha: It's good in general no?
Feb 28, 7:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How would their perception of me change when I don't get in anywhere?
Feb 28, 7:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Top Chemical Engineering Universities - Chemical Engineering University Rankings And Top Colleges For Chemical Engineering - http://www.accesseducationindia.com/top-chemical-engineering-courses-usa.html
Feb 28, 7:23 AM - Yashmitha: You didn't apply right.. That's why 😕
Feb 28, 7:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: All those she got admits from, are ranked 35+
Feb 28, 7:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: On the basis of this, Purdue is the highest.
Feb 28, 7:27 AM - Yashmitha: She didn't get Purdue
Feb 28, 7:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Your other friend got no?
Feb 28, 7:27 AM - Yashmitha: That was Apurupa
Feb 28, 7:28 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Feb 28, 7:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: See Houston. It's right up there. Similar ranking. And their acceptance rate is high.
Feb 28, 7:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Same with TAMU
Feb 28, 7:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The name of the University isn't indicative of its quality in that domain re. It's never like that. It's like saying Sachin Tendulkar is a good cricketer so we can assume he can bowl or field really well.
Feb 28, 7:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Every place has its forte.
Feb 28, 7:29 AM - Yashmitha: Hmmmm.. True Bub
Feb 28, 7:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: See? I told you about Houston and Davis and all no?
Feb 28, 7:29 AM - Yashmitha: You text too much ya. Pah 😝
Feb 28, 7:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's ranked highly
Feb 28, 7:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: UCSB also I told you :The
Feb 28, 7:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Paah is good 😝
Feb 28, 7:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Means you like 😘
Feb 28, 7:32 AM - Yashmitha: Your head 😝
Feb 28, 7:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Have you noticed one fascinating thing? The percentage of admits is proportional to the stature and name of the college. Not to the actual quality or the ranking. That just means that more people send to those than the others, even if they're actually good.
Feb 28, 7:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm also one of those idiots :P
Feb 28, 7:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, I know you like :P I also like 😘
Feb 28, 7:35 AM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Yes you're ab idiot.
Feb 28, 7:36 AM - Yashmitha: Okay now I'll go. Pah. Don't force me to block you 😝
Feb 28, 7:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You won't do that no? :P
Feb 28, 7:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You won't do that no? 😞
Feb 28, 7:36 AM - Yashmitha: Have a nice day! I'll see you if I can today

Feb 28, 7:53 AM - Yashmitha: You're the first. Everyone else sees gold & cream 😝
Feb 28, 7:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Blue is not even close to white!
Feb 28, 7:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Nonsense people.
Feb 28, 7:53 AM - Yashmitha: Exactly 😑
Feb 28, 7:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But you know what I've found?

Feb 28, 8:06 AM - Yashmitha: Shut up 😂
Feb 28, 8:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: ☺ making fun of you is the best thing ever :p
Feb 28, 8:14 AM - Yashmitha: 😑
Feb 28, 8:14 AM - Yashmitha: Go be productive fool!
Feb 28, 8:14 AM - Yashmitha: Have a nice day. Byeee.
Feb 28, 8:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah man. Chill. Out.

Mar 1, 1:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This is so strange, but I think I saw you at Clarence!
Mar 1, 1:51 PM - Yashmitha: Hi. I wasn't at Clarence. Lol stop dreaming 😂
Mar 1, 1:51 PM - Yashmitha: I was in hennur

Mar 1, 1:52 PM - Yashmitha: Balls 😂
Mar 1, 1:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aye, you stared at me also.

Mar 1, 2:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Mar 1, 2:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I just realised what this is like. You and me. A lot of times, it's like me trying to win the affections/approval/attention of parents that really don't want to give any of that away :P
Mar 1, 2:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And it suddenly made me feel really uncomfortable :P
Mar 1, 2:11 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly 😝

Mar 1, 2:16 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know yet re
Mar 1, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
Mar 1, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You have internals no?
Mar 1, 2:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Rotaract?
Mar 1, 2:17 PM - Yashmitha: Oh fuck! 😳
Mar 1, 2:17 PM - Yashmitha: I have internals!
Mar 1, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/ you told me you have internals so you can't meet on Sunday
Mar 1, 2:18 PM - Yashmitha: I met you yesterday!
Mar 1, 2:18 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Mar 1, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When I asked you on the phone yesterday you said that mam.
Mar 1, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *man
Mar 1, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😒
Mar 1, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm making that face :P
Mar 1, 2:20 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂
Mar 1, 2:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't need the emoji anymore
Mar 1, 2:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay listen, don't screw the internal up.
Mar 1, 2:21 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Yeah. 
I won't. Mostly won't go. Forgot about internals 😝
Mar 1, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Where you have to go though? With college people?
Mar 1, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I ate too much today!
Mar 1, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Feels like I'll explode.
Mar 1, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I didn't say no to anything. My stomach is a bottomless pit!
Mar 1, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You want to challenge me to an eatoff?
Mar 1, 2:22 PM - Yashmitha: You eat so much! 😂
Mar 1, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I ate give dosas thus morning :P
Mar 1, 2:22 PM - Yashmitha: Prableen in the picture! Lol

Mar 1, 2:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Whoever keeps on eating, wins.
Mar 1, 2:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some neighbor re.
Mar 1, 2:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't even know the person. The wedding itself was a dreadful experience. People do it for the sake of it. It's pretension. The priest is doing his thing around the fire, the bride and groom are busy shaking hands and accepting gifts. And all this is being recorded and photographed. For the sake of photos or videos you should pretend no? I didn't like it :/ 
All the people also, just running around, talking, laughing. No one's looking at the stage only. They're taking selfies and all. So sick!
Mar 1, 2:29 PM - Yashmitha: Every wedding is like that
Mar 1, 2:29 PM - Yashmitha: You please don't have anything but a registered wedding 😝
Mar 1, 2:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then it's really stupid re. Ceremonies and rituals mean something.
Mar 1, 2:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You shut up. Have you seen weddings in church? At least the rituals mean something. People have to shut up and follow along or not come at all.
Mar 1, 2:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the serious part, the reception is the fun part.
Mar 1, 2:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The roce also, fun part. There's a place for everything :P
Mar 1, 2:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This wedding was too bad!
Mar 1, 2:31 PM - Yashmitha: Every ceremony means something. The rituals symbolise something.
Mar 1, 2:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But people don't give a damn no?
Mar 1, 2:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The ones that are integral part of it only don't care.
Mar 1, 2:31 PM - Yashmitha: Haha
Mar 1, 2:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't tell me it's okay to smile and do makeup and accept money while the ceremony is going on.
Mar 1, 2:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a farce.
Mar 1, 2:33 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not telling you anything at all. Lol
Mar 1, 2:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meaning?
Mar 1, 2:33 PM - Yashmitha: No wedding makes sense really. Lol
Mar 1, 2:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Have I ever told you?
Mar 1, 2:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Being Wed or being committed is all in the mind?
Mar 1, 2:34 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly why I said you shouldn't have a wedding ceremony :P
Mar 1, 2:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I sometimes feel like we're married :P
Mar 1, 2:34 PM - Yashmitha: I hope you find a Tam Brahm wife 😝
Mar 1, 2:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We keep fighting, keep fighting, but we can't live without :P
Mar 1, 2:35 PM - Yashmitha: That's not what weddings are about 😕
Mar 1, 2:35 PM - Yashmitha: And if we're married, I'd be divorced for infidelity 😝
Mar 1, 2:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, I meant that we can recover from the worst of situations!
Mar 1, 2:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What'd you go do? Why do you keep saying that?
Mar 1, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What aren't you telling me??
Mar 1, 2:36 PM - Yashmitha: Awwwww!!!!
Mar 1, 2:36 PM - Yashmitha: Who?? Such a nice picture!!
Mar 1, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Prableen
Mar 1, 2:37 PM - Yashmitha: Okay now it's ruined 😝
Mar 1, 2:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, now What's this infidelity nonsense? 😞
Mar 1, 2:37 PM - Yashmitha: Eh? I'm kidding man.
Mar 1, 2:37 PM - Yashmitha: Pah 😕
Mar 1, 2:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww? :(
Mar 1, 2:38 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Why? You'd be upset if I made out with someone? 😜
Mar 1, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Mar 1, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only because you keep saying no to me 😒
Mar 1, 2:40 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. I want to mind fuck you but you'll take me seriously 😂😂
Mar 1, 2:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You forgot what it's like to make out with me?
Mar 1, 2:41 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. It's been two years almost. 😂😂
Mar 1, 2:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It hasn't been too years 😒
Mar 1, 2:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In my mind, it was seconds ago 😝
Mar 1, 2:41 PM - Yashmitha: Almost!
Mar 1, 2:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't mean to be crude but I'm still aroused by you :P
Mar 1, 2:42 PM - Yashmitha: I had free lunch today. At Benito's 😝
Mar 1, 2:43 PM - Yashmitha: Rotary sponsored
Mar 1, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's how you respond? 😑
Mar 1, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've had more free lunches than you missy.
Mar 1, 2:44 PM - Yashmitha: You shouldn't have free lunches. It's for poor people 😜
Mar 1, 2:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll beat you.
Mar 1, 2:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like saying something, but I don't think you'll take it in the right spirit
Mar 1, 2:46 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. You're always saying something 😝
Mar 1, 2:46 PM - Yashmitha: So much you talk!
Mar 1, 2:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know, after all these years, it hasn't reached a point where I can say anything I want
Mar 1, 2:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You still get upset, despite knowing that I never mean any offense or harm :/
Mar 1, 2:47 PM - Yashmitha: You still say anything you want 😂
Mar 1, 2:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think that's fair.. Do you?
Mar 1, 2:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No man, I don't. The times I do say something and you end up feeling bad or getting upset is when I thought I was saying something harmless
Mar 1, 2:48 PM - Yashmitha: Lol.
Mar 1, 2:49 PM - Yashmitha: Listen re. Brb. I'll ttyl
Mar 1, 2:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not like I've known you only for six hours that I have to think and be careful about what I say no? :/

Mar 1, 9:00 PM - Yashmitha: Sounds chinese
Mar 1, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's kickass
Mar 1, 9:01 PM - Yashmitha: Everyone will laugh at me 😛
Mar 1, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Have you been living under a rock? 😒
Mar 1, 9:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't know xiaomi?
Mar 1, 9:03 PM - Yashmitha: Nobody knows I think
Mar 1, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😒
Mar 1, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only I know.
Mar 1, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No?
Mar 1, 9:04 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Mar 1, 9:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay.
Mar 1, 9:04 PM - Yashmitha: Im not even surprised😛
Mar 1, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're a fail 😒
Mar 1, 9:06 PM - Yashmitha: 😢
Mar 1, 9:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We need to talk..
Mar 1, 9:08 PM - Yashmitha: Okay now tell me
Mar 1, 9:09 PM - Yashmitha: Yes.. talk
Mar 1, 9:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I typed it out earlier okay?
Mar 1, 9:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a bit long
Mar 1, 9:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know I've been talking too much lately, I don't know why. I know you really don't care, your responses say as much. But I want to tell you that whatever you call what we have, friendship/convenience, whatever, it's not fair that I speak and you don't even listen. 

I know that'd be a problem if it was something irritating like me asking you constantly to go out with me and being emo. "my heart's in a million pieces without you", etc. But it's not like that. 

When I share something with you, like who I'm attracted to, where I am, what I've been reading, I'm trying to start a conversation or just showing you something interesting. You're the one that I felt like sharing it with. When you say nothing about it, should I just move on like nothing happened? 

When people have become the sort that require validation in the form of likes or comments on Facebook posts and pictures, how can a personal message be brushed off so coldly? 

Conversations with you leave me feeling hollow inside. You don't share, you don't really contribute. Not of your own accord, not even when I ask or say something.. 

Mar 1, 9:09 PM - Yashmitha: Send:)
Mar 1, 9:11 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm..
Mar 1, 9:12 PM - Yashmitha: Im usually talking to multiple people at once so thats how I text everybody
Mar 1, 9:12 PM - Yashmitha: 😐
Mar 1, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You actually talk? But how? What do you say when you're not paying attention?
Mar 1, 9:13 PM - Yashmitha: I usually ignore the messages only when it gets too personal
Mar 1, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
Mar 1, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I guess it's only a phase. You remember a few weeks ago no? It wasn't like this.
Mar 1, 9:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It'll stop.
Mar 1, 9:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't worry.
Mar 1, 9:15 PM - Yashmitha: Im not worried.. you are nice to listen to except when its about us😝
Mar 1, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to talk to you!
Mar 1, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It hurts!
Mar 1, 9:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm tired of trying. Nothing works with you.
Mar 1, 9:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only when it's convenient we talk. The reason we spoke so much jus now was only because of your phone problem.
Mar 1, 9:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hate being that person someone would go to only to solve problems!
Mar 1, 9:17 PM - Yashmitha: We wouldnt be talking at all if I hadnt fixed that
Mar 1, 9:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You didn't give a shit when I sent you that photo of Julianna Margulies.
Mar 1, 9:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When I told you about me feeling philosophical and needing to talk.
Mar 1, 9:18 PM - Yashmitha: You dont solve all my problems.  Just saying.  I dont rant to you
Mar 1, 9:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, I know.
Mar 1, 9:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All those problems that ensure I find out nothing of significance about you.
Mar 1, 9:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing personal.
Mar 1, 9:19 PM - Yashmitha: And I told you ill brb. You decided to keep texting
Mar 1, 9:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Which college? Who to contact? How to clear messages? How to send recommendations?
Mar 1, 9:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's all this has been reduced to. Ask yourself if that's true or not.
Mar 1, 9:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All your other relationships with other people are worth more than that I feel. True or not?
Mar 1, 9:20 PM - Yashmitha: I dont get too personal with anyone
Mar 1, 9:21 PM - Yashmitha: wait
Mar 1, 9:21 PM - Yashmitha: Dinner
Mar 1, 9:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
Mar 1, 9:48 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah.. I dont
Mar 1, 9:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Back?
Mar 1, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You might've said BRB, but when something comes up and I want to say it, I say it. I didn't say "Poke poke Poke, reply right now!" or anything like that. I just sent it. Do you wait for me to be online before texting everyday? You're just coming up with excuses now :/
Mar 1, 9:53 PM - Yashmitha: Come on fb
Mar 1, 9:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Message, I'll reply.
Mar 1, 9:53 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Mar 1, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Listen, you want to go jogging in the mornings?
Mar 1, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm getting fat :/
Mar 1, 10:45 PM - Yashmitha: im too sleepy to. Think!
Mar 1, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😂
Mar 1, 10:46 PM - Yashmitha: And balls. Im not a morning person. I wake up at 8
Mar 1, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😑
Mar 1, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll make you a morning person 😏
Mar 1, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Not even you can
Mar 1, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Okay listen dont irritate
Mar 1, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ✌
Mar 1, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: I said good night already
Mar 1, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Batman, over and out.
Mar 1, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Bye now
Mar 1, 10:49 PM - Yashmitha: 😂
Mar 1, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I have a theory, I'll tell you tomorrow :p
Mar 1, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Thanks for the concern
Mar 1, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Much appreciation
Mar 1, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: 😒
Mar 2, 9:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Someone got swine flu in the hostel :/
Mar 2, 9:14 PM - Yashmitha: 😳😳😳
Mar 2, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If something happens to me, don't forget me off okay? 😝
Mar 2, 9:17 PM - Yashmitha: 😐
Mar 2, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One last thing okay? If I can get tickets to mangalore will you come? Just for a day. On 5th. There's a quiz in the morning at surathkal. After that we can explore mangalore, eat and go to the beach. Arvind backed out again. If I can get another team together I'll go but it won't be any decent sort of company for me.
Mar 2, 9:27 PM - Yashmitha: Not alone with a boy . Final year. No scope😂
Mar 2, 9:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Eh?
Mar 2, 9:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you mean? 
Also, you might think I'm being weird about the tiny one. But she started it. She's always said to me that I should find someone who likes her so I'll have time for her. But then she went and did something quite the opposite and now we don't really talk anymore.
Mar 2, 9:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What does final year have to do with anything?

Okay, you go study or something 
I have work to do 
Good night!
Mar 2, 9:43 PM - Yashmitha: Okay😄
Mar 2, 9:43 PM - Yashmitha: Lets see
Mar 2, 9:44 PM - Yashmitha: Good night😄
Mar 2, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm going with some random guy and then I'll loaf around in Mangalore alone 😎
Mar 2, 10:02 PM - Yashmitha: 😐
Mar 2, 10:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ??
Mar 2, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think aanchal and I just had a fight
Mar 2, 10:11 PM - Yashmitha: Why
Mar 2, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a funny story :P
Mar 2, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She wants me to come to surathkal so Sharma will have company :/
Mar 2, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like being used like that. So she asks me if I can't go anywhere for fun when I told her I don't have a quiz team. I said no, I can't coz there's no one to have fun with.
Mar 2, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She said "don't ever come for any trip". And then she said I have "adi" for company. I ignored all those messages. And I think she got offended. 
In the end she says don't come.
Mar 2, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The other day she forces manika to come to a football game so she can also go. Coz he was going.
Mar 2, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: Weird people all over the world
Mar 2, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh.. I find the weirdest ones :P
Mar 2, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: Not really
Mar 2, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: Everyone is.like that
Mar 2, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: Even my friends are.weird😁
Mar 2, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not weird but no?

Mar 2, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night is only for me.
Mar 2, 10:39 PM - Yashmitha: I'm fucking blocking you now.
Mar 2, 10:39 PM - Yashmitha: It's really none of your business.
Mar 2, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I just felt like talking to you . I'm impulsive. It's not even weird like earlier, whatever you had a problem with. If I can't be frank with you then this is meaningless. I don't want this to be the sort of thing where I have to think everytime I feel like saying something.
Mar 2, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sorry again. 
Bye..
Mar 2, 10:49 PM - Yashmitha: You don't
Mar 2, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: But If im online and you text and I dont text back you'll get

Mar 2, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Ugh
Mar 2, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fuck it. My problems are my problems. No point trying to discuss them with you. All it does is give me more problems to deal with :/
Mar 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: I'm dealing with.something here too..simply 😐
Mar 2, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You want to talk to me about it?

Mar 2, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh
Mar 2, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: It's okay. I wasn't looking for you to.lol
Mar 2, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: Good night
Mar 2, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like hitting something!
Mar 2, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm obsessing over you and you're obsessing over someone else.. Classic case of heart break for me :l
Mar 2, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like deva vu..
Mar 2, 11:14 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not! This was something else !
Mar 2, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just one thing before we go.. To conclude all that has happened today.
Mar 2, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who am I to you? Because I think I've made various assumptions, based on which I've taken various sorts of liberties.
Mar 3, 7:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Sweetheart :) sorry I upset you yesterday. You know how sometimes I just can't stop talking to you? I hope you don't think of it as a bad thing :/ 
I hope your problems dissipate soon so we can talk freely again :l

Mar 6, 10:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't you keep swearing at me all the time? Is that something you can control or change? You do that on purpose. About me being angry or raising my voice, it doesn't even happen.. When was the last time before today? :/

Mar 6, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The point at which you had the idea is the right point to start at.. Tell me, how long will it take for someone else to think of the same idea? If someone put off their ideas for later, do you think even the other people will?

Mar 8, 7:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: As though you've been programmed to only talk for an hour you're acting
Mar 8, 7:10 PM - Yashmitha: Im a robot. 😂
Mar 8, 7:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know I'm feeling bad right now don't you? That this isn't the time to be joking?
Mar 8, 7:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Stupid shit.
Mar 8, 7:12 PM - Yashmitha: Bubbaaa. Chill in life. 😁
Mar 8, 7:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can we please fucking have a conversation where you read and reply immediately? You're too upsetting..

Mar 8, 7:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Everything is a joke to you.
Mar 8, 7:14 PM - Yashmitha: Go man. Irritating.

Mar 8, 9:47 PM - Yashmitha: 🙈
Mar 8, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why give them female names? Glassman has said that Fran leaves you crushed and exhausted and joked that “any workout that leaves you flat on your back, staring up at the sky, wondering what the hell happened, deserves a girl’s name.”
Mar 8, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So apparently, all Crossfit training routines are named after women. And the founder explains it thusly.
Mar 8, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: I should join crossfit.
Mar 8, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: You know why no😉

Mar 23, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂
Mar 23, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One day I won't talk to you anymore
Mar 23, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're very strange okay? When I'm not talking to you, you get me to talk. Then when I talk you want me to not talk.
Mar 23, 9:51 PM - Yashmitha: You won't. I'm amazing. You can't not talk to me.
Mar 23, 9:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you challenging me? :P
Mar 23, 9:51 PM - Yashmitha: Yes

Mar 23, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes I'm a baby
Mar 23, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes you're also a baby.
Mar 23, 10:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like catching and squishing you. 😘
Mar 23, 10:10 PM - Yashmitha: I'm always a baby 😛
Mar 23, 10:10 PM - Yashmitha: I'm squishy 😊
Mar 23, 10:10 PM - Yashmitha: You are not.
Mar 23, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So what?
Mar 23, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm squishing you no?
Mar 23, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not asking you to squish me. Aiyyooooo
Mar 23, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: 😂
Mar 23, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: I couldn't even if I wanted to 😝
Mar 23, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The fact that squishing someone feels nice is a lot to do with the mindset also bummy
Mar 23, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't want to squish me so you think it's not possible or it won't be nice.
Mar 23, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: I think that you're too thin. That's all 😝
Mar 23, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: Squisher😝
Mar 23, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what?
Mar 23, 10:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you see me no? Like on the inside, you won't find me skinny. I'm not bony anywhere. Neither am I shapeless like a 10 year old
Mar 23, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know I eat no? I'm not consciously trying to be thin or a anything. 😊
Come here squisheeee! *eeeee*
Mar 23, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Huggy my baby 😘
Mar 23, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ☺☺☺
Mar 23, 10:30 PM - Yashmitha: Yes you're not shapeless
Mar 23, 10:30 PM - Yashmitha: Good only
Mar 23, 10:30 PM - Yashmitha: Pretty boy.
Mar 23, 10:30 PM - Yashmitha: Please don't cut your hair 😝
Mar 23, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I finally feel sort of comfortable with myself you know?
Mar 23, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: With my height and all that
Mar 23, 10:31 PM - Yashmitha: I'm glad!! That's your first step to success!
Mar 23, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It doesn't bother me anymore
Mar 23, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😊
Mar 23, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: That's good bub. What I wanted to talk about has a lot to do with you being happy on the inside with the things you do 😄
Mar 23, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I cut it coz I used to feel really silly when I wear and take off the helmet and all
Mar 23, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It sticks to my head. Or it becomes wavy in a really stupid fashion.
Mar 23, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I cut it coz at least like this there's no reason to be worried that it'll look like anything other than its supposed to look like
Mar 23, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a relief re. One thing less to worry about.
Tell me, doesn't it bother you about how your hair looks and how it's sitting and stuff like that? You need to look into the mirror to make sure it's perfectly in place and all?
Mar 23, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've seen Mark Zuckerberg no? He always wears these grey t-shirts. Apparently that's all he has in the wardrobe. Coz he's sick of worrying about things. This way, one less thing to worry about. 
Same with Steve Jobs and the turtleneck. 
That's also why you see so many high-profile people clean shaven and with short hair. It's so much easier looking like what you want. Without effort.
Mar 23, 10:38 PM - Yashmitha: Wow. Major explanation 😛
Mar 23, 10:38 PM - Yashmitha: But if you like it, it's cool. I can get used to it 😛
Mar 23, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww?
Mar 23, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just experimenting with my look. I'll grow it out for a while now 😊
Mar 23, 10:39 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah it will 😃
Mar 23, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it's really cool no? How people with many decisions to make have to do such things for peace of mind?
Mar 23, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It really fascinates me. While I'm worrying about internals and college and all that, they're making decisions that shape the world.
Mar 23, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Makes me feel so small!
Mar 23, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: Bub. You are making excuses to not care about internals 😛
Mar 23, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: Funny kid 😂😂😂😂

Mar 23, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You like hearing what's on my mind np?
Mar 23, 10:46 PM - Yashmitha: I do. Just not excuses to not study 😛

Mar 25, 10:09 PM - Yashmitha: Worried
Mar 25, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't worry
Mar 25, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay. If it doesn't happen this time, it wasn't meant to be this time. No? Life's much longer. One year is nothing 😊
Mar 25, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I realised something today
Mar 25, 10:13 PM - Yashmitha: That's not the thing re.
Mar 25, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No one has a plan. No one thinks. Not like me.
Mar 25, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: You're smart but don't make wise decisions sometimes. 
That's true.. They only have back up plans.
Mar 25, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They just say "Oh let's go to the US"
Mar 25, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They don't know why, they don't care for what, they don't care where. Everyone'll just go
Mar 25, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They'll go for courses they have no idea about!
Mar 25, 10:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Thousands of people. They'll just go..
Mar 25, 10:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But what happens to all these people? Lakhs would've gone since the first person started going. Where are they all?
Mar 25, 10:17 PM - Yashmitha: Making good money somewhere no bub?
Mar 25, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the thing! Everyone assumes they are, but no one can tell you whether that's true or not
Mar 25, 10:18 PM - Yashmitha: It's true re.. The ones I know are at least
Mar 25, 10:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But you know what the worst part is? If I asked you to be a lecturer in some college here, and paid a lac + every month, would you?
Mar 25, 10:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's good money.
Mar 25, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I suddenly feel lost. I don't know what I was trying to say 😝
Mar 25, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mar 25, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: Rofl! Bub you're becoming too funny 😂
Mar 25, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😞

Mar 25, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What?
Mar 25, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: I wish I applied to UCSD 😞
Mar 25, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: I really wanted California..
Mar 25, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww :/ I told you to no? I told you to pick one of those places
Mar 25, 10:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can always move there though

Mar 25, 10:23 PM - Yashmitha: *guess
Mar 25, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know why I didn't want to apply to the smaller places?
Mar 25, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The  people you hear about in the news, the ones that make it big, they're almost invariably from these places!
Mar 25, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There has got to be something special about those places then no? Am I stupid for wanting them? Or for holding out for them?
Mar 25, 10:27 PM - Yashmitha: Of course not. But knowing your stakes, it's not wise to be so ambitious..
Mar 25, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What are my stakes?
Mar 25, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's never not wise to be ambitious.
Mar 25, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Without ambition, man is just a vegetable :/
Mar 25, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Life has always been difficult for me. I've worked harder, longer than most but I still get outdone. I hate it sometimes..
Mar 25, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hate that no matter what I do, I don't control what becomes of me.
Mar 25, 10:34 PM - Yashmitha: I really need to talk to you. You have internals tomorrow?

Mar 25, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😘
Mar 25, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hope we never lose this. But I'm afraid we might someday <>
Mar 25, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Missy! You know what a muffin top is?
Mar 25, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Don't let your fear of what might happen make nothing happen!

Mar 29, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Pookie

Mar 29, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: 😂
Mar 29, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: You should though 😛
Mar 29, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What I should?
Mar 29, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to hold you ☺

Mar 29, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: 😓
Mar 29, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why you didn't kiss me off today missy?
Mar 29, 11:47 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know. It didn't happen 😐
Mar 29, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww?
Mar 29, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay 😊
Mar 29, 11:48 PM - Yashmitha: 😓😓
Mar 29, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why I was asking how much you like me and app
Mar 29, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All
Mar 29, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Can't be quantified re
Mar 29, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: Stupid
Mar 29, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: Okay I'm tired
Mar 29, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: Can't text continously
Mar 29, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: I'll ttyl?
Mar 29, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm
Mar 29, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm confused about us.. Is something holding you back?
Mar 29, 11:56 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know re.. I really don't
Mar 29, 11:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okayyy
Mar 29, 11:58 PM - Yashmitha: I like you. I know that.
Mar 29, 11:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If I make you uncomfortable, then that makes me uncomfortable. You know that no?
Mar 29, 11:58 PM - Yashmitha: But I feel odd for some reason.. I don't know. You don't make me uncomfortable
Mar 29, 11:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What sort of odd sweetheart?
Mar 29, 11:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For me, you feel like a part of me :*
Mar 30, 12:00 AM - Yashmitha: I feel like because of my whole Shayak scene, I'm doing injustice to you..
Mar 30, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How?
Mar 30, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Is that still on?
Mar 30, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you still want him?
Mar 30, 12:01 AM - Yashmitha: No. I feel horrible about what he did so I'm upset and don't want to get into something.. Feels like rebound
Mar 30, 12:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You feel horrible about him going after someone else?
Mar 30, 12:02 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah. Without explanation. Really weird.
Mar 30, 12:02 AM - Yashmitha: Happened with you & me too..
Mar 30, 12:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You could look at it as something that brought us together.
Mar 30, 12:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The next nice thing that happens because of a bad thing that happened is the very reason the bad thing happened.
Mar 30, 12:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay? Then life becomes perfect 😋
Mar 30, 12:04 AM - Yashmitha: Oho. Okay bub 😂
Mar 30, 12:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😩
Mar 30, 12:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll always laugh at me
Mar 30, 12:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, its rebound if you come after me. Not if I come after you. So you don't think so much. Leave the thinking to me 😜
Mar 30, 12:09 AM - Yashmitha: 😂
Mar 30, 12:09 AM - Yashmitha: Bub can I text to morrow?
Mar 30, 12:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes

Mar 30, 9:17 AM - Yashmitha: Mad or what?
Mar 30, 9:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know re. I don't know how serious the situation with the project is no? Sometimes it can be messed up :-/
Mar 30, 9:22 AM - Yashmitha: It's bad..
Mar 30, 9:22 AM - Yashmitha: Real bad
Mar 30, 9:22 AM - Yashmitha: Bub listen
Mar 30, 9:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww :/
Mar 30, 9:22 AM - Yashmitha: Please order one tempered glass screen protector for me no?
Mar 30, 9:22 AM - Yashmitha: Online
Mar 30, 9:23 AM - Yashmitha: And any phone cover also.. I like the transparent one
Mar 30, 9:23 AM - Yashmitha: Just order online.. Is cheap
Mar 30, 9:23 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If you really want it, we should go to a store and get it. These things are negotiable :-/
Mar 30, 9:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've bought phone covers and screen guards before. It's really not worth going online for it because the ones you get there are the same shitty chinese products!
Mar 30, 9:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You trust me no?
Mar 30, 9:24 AM - Yashmitha: It's one fifty bucks bub.. No one sells for lesser. I'm serious
Mar 30, 9:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmmm. Okay..
Mar 30, 9:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Send me the link
Mar 30, 9:26 AM - Yashmitha: Search on flipkart for the tempered glass
Mar 30, 9:26 AM - Yashmitha: The phone cover link I sent that day no?
Mar 30, 9:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Send me the one you like no?
Mar 30, 9:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know where it went. You can re-send it?
Mar 30, 9:28 AM - Yashmitha: I can barely keep my eyes open re
Mar 30, 9:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, you're aware that each product will cost 100 rupees additional for delivery right?
Mar 30, 9:32 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And it'll only come by April 8th.
Mar 30, 9:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The transparent cover you asked for has some of the worst reviews I've seen :-/
Mar 30, 9:34 AM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo
Mar 30, 9:34 AM - Yashmitha: Don't bother
Mar 30, 9:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: http://www.flipkart.com/konnect-back-cover-moto-g-2nd-generation/product-reviews/ITMEFKCYVZFCEG9W?pid=ACCEFKCYYYAQWAKW&type=all

Mar 30, 9:35 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The phone cover will come by April 10th. 100 rupees delivery charges.
Mar 30, 9:35 AM - Yashmitha: Leave it re
Mar 30, 9:35 AM - Yashmitha: Don't bother
Mar 30, 9:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Trust me sometimes no?
Mar 30, 9:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I happen to actually know about these things :-/ When you don't take my word for it, its insulting 😞
Mar 30, 9:37 AM - Yashmitha: Calm down
Mar 30, 9:37 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm serious. It matters what you think.
Mar 30, 9:39 AM - Yashmitha: Bub. Not like I don't trust you. I just need it really badly & you don't seem to be in any hurry.
Mar 30, 9:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: People online are complaining that the cover doesn't fit and feels cheap and all :/
Mar 30, 9:42 AM - Yashmitha: Okay.. If you go out, can you get one for me?
Mar 30, 9:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll go get your screen protector as soon as you can get out?
Mar 30, 9:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's best if we let them apply
Mar 30, 9:43 AM - Yashmitha: I know re
Mar 30, 9:43 AM - Yashmitha: Screen protector is too costly offline
Mar 30, 9:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But April 8th/10th
Mar 30, 9:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And 100 rupees delivery
Mar 30, 9:45 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you think I'm hot? :P
Mar 30, 9:59 AM - Yashmitha: You're good looking. No one week deny that
Mar 30, 10:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: ☺
Mar 30, 10:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to come and see you
Mar 30, 10:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to make you feel better 😞
Mar 30, 10:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, so apparently you get eye drops that stimulate artificial tears. That's supposed to help.
Mar 30, 10:05 AM - Yashmitha: I can't text re
Mar 30, 10:05 AM - Yashmitha: I know. I'll get it to
Mar 30, 10:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Want me to call?
Mar 30, 10:10 AM - Yashmitha: No
Mar 30, 10:10 AM - Yashmitha: Discussing Shimoga
Mar 30, 10:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Kay 😝
Mar 30, 5:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Mar 30, 5:53 PM - Yashmitha: 😄
Mar 30, 5:53 PM - Yashmitha: To?
Mar 30, 5:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: To nowhere
Mar 30, 5:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was feeling restless
Mar 30, 6:39 PM - Yashmitha: Me too. I hate being confined 😐
Mar 30, 6:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm
Mar 30, 6:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chutki..
Mar 30, 6:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want you :)
Mar 30, 6:43 PM - Yashmitha: You wanna say something different bub?
Mar 30, 6:43 PM - Yashmitha: 😋
Mar 30, 6:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meaning?
Mar 30, 7:15 PM - Yashmitha: Just kidding. Lol
Mar 30, 7:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Kidding about what missy?
Mar 30, 7:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't understand
Mar 30, 8:29 PM - Yashmitha: Women drivers eventually turn into good drivers 😄
Mar 30, 8:29 PM - Yashmitha: So if you're a good driver, watch out for a woman driver 😂😂
Mar 30, 8:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you keep ignoring my messages it won't make me feel good..
Mar 30, 8:49 PM - Yashmitha: I lose track of what I'm saying re.. Not even important
Mar 30, 9:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay
Mar 30, 9:13 PM - Yashmitha: I'm so worried about admissions now
Mar 30, 9:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why?
Mar 30, 9:14 PM - Yashmitha: It's April
Mar 30, 9:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh..
Mar 30, 9:14 PM - Yashmitha: Where are my decisions?
Mar 30, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I won't give you decisions.
Mar 30, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I flicked them off.
Mar 30, 9:17 PM - Yashmitha: Shoo 😐
Mar 30, 9:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How you feeling?
Mar 30, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: Better.. I think it's the heat bub
Mar 30, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Mar 30, 9:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You want to know something?
Mar 30, 9:47 PM - Yashmitha: It's bad news?
Mar 30, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Actually leave..
Mar 30, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It doesn't matter :)
Mar 30, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: Not admission related no?
Mar 30, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just me related. Not important.
Mar 30, 9:56 PM - Yashmitha: Tell me re
Mar 30, 9:56 PM - Yashmitha: What's the matter?
Mar 30, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing
Mar 30, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: Tell me 😐
Mar 30, 10:08 PM - Yashmitha: What happened re?
Mar 30, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Let's not talk about it. You have other things to be worried about.
Mar 30, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: I do
Mar 30, 10:22 PM - Yashmitha: Doesn't mean I won't talk about what's worrying you
Mar 30, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Let's forget I said anything?
Mar 30, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll talk about this another time
Mar 30, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: Okay
Mar 30, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: How you feeling about Tech bytes?
Mar 30, 10:27 PM - Yashmitha: Prepared to kill it? 😄
Mar 30, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not really feeling much
Mar 30, 10:27 PM - Yashmitha: What time & where?
Mar 30, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: SJBIT
Mar 30, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 11 I think.
Mar 30, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: Where's SJBIT?
Mar 30, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Uttarhalli main road
Mar 30, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Next to BGS
Mar 30, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: So far.. I want to come watch
Mar 30, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not well no
Mar 30, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: I think I'll be okay tomorrow
Mar 30, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's too far. Not worth the trouble re
Mar 30, 10:36 PM - Yashmitha: But I want to! Last time probably 😑
Mar 30, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Last time what?
Mar 30, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've given up.. I don't really care about tomorrow's result..
Mar 30, 10:38 PM - Yashmitha: What's the matter with you?
Mar 30, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: 😐
Mar 30, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know how to tell you what's up with me.
Mar 30, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think I'm depressed.
Mar 30, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: It's about us?
Mar 30, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's about me
Mar 30, 10:52 PM - Yashmitha: Tell sweetie
Mar 30, 10:52 PM - Yashmitha: Why are you so upset?
Mar 30, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If I knew I'd tell you..
Mar 30, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't point to a single thing that makes me happy
Mar 30, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not one.
Mar 30, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: Yesterday didn't make you happy?
Mar 30, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing that makes me upbeat or hopeful or gives me something to look forward to.
Mar 30, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yesterday made me happy in some ways, made me sad in some others.
Mar 30, 10:55 PM - Yashmitha: You're easily depressed.. Shit.
Mar 30, 10:55 PM - Yashmitha: Can you call me in a bit?
Mar 30, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't get to decide whether I'm easily depressed or not do you?
Mar 30, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can Skype you.. Can you Skype me back?
Mar 30, 10:56 PM - Yashmitha: Come here.. Calm down re. I'm not judging
Mar 30, 10:57 PM - Yashmitha: Skype I can't.. Laptop is with mom
Mar 30, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ok
Mar 30, 11:01 PM - Yashmitha: You can't call then?
Mar 30, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Did you get whatsapp calling?
Mar 30, 11:01 PM - Yashmitha: No..
Mar 30, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know someone who has?
Mar 30, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: You 😝
Mar 30, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: Rini
Mar 30, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't have
Mar 30, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: Didn't you say she called using that?
Mar 30, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. But it didn't enable for me.
Mar 30, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's supposed to, after you receive a call
Mar 30, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: That's messed up
Mar 30, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: Leave it
Mar 30, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: I'll just text you
Mar 30, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: See, I have to tell you something
Mar 30, 11:04 PM - Yashmitha: I'm no one to judge that you get easily upset.. But you can't argue that that's not true.. Things haven't been working out for you. There hasn't been anything you've achieved of late & I think for a person like you, that's a huge setback
Mar 30, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: You constantly feel the need to achieve something. To keep pushing yourself.
Mar 30, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: I think that you need to figure out a flowchart.. Where your life is going for the next two years. Weigh out all the pros & cons
Mar 30, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: Decide what to do with your career & take the necessary steps
Mar 30, 11:06 PM - Yashmitha: And most importantly, whatever little thing you do bub, make sure it's something that makes you happy
Mar 30, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: Enjoy everything you do.. Don't just do it coz you want to prove that you can. That you're not going to lose. You're not fighting against anyone.. But yourself.
Mar 30, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: Never be satisfied with what you've achieved.. But please be happy
Mar 30, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Otherwise there's really no point of life.. You need to tell yourself that you're good & you'll keep striving
Mar 30, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Not be dejected, ever.. Momentarily is okay.. But when I read your sop, it showed me how hurt you let yourself get
Mar 30, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: That's harmful.. Don't do it.. You've been brought into this world for a reason.. Be the best that you can be.. Keep trying but always stay happy
Mar 30, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: Without that, there's no point how much you achieve
Mar 30, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: Unlike others, I don't see you being happy just doing a quiz. Even winning doesn't matter sometimes. But losing. You get so hard on yourself!
Mar 30, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: Find the things that you enjoy doing.. Or start enjoying things that you do
Mar 30, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know, if I disappeared right now, it wouldn't matter to me?
Mar 30, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: It would to me. I love you & I need to see you be happy about everything
Mar 30, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: At least sometimes. Everyone gets unhappy.. But so often, is not a good thing 😐
Mar 30, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what to say.
Mar 30, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've always believed that I'm very capable, but now I'm starting to see that this is not necessarily true.
Mar 30, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's nothing going on in my life right now that I'm looking forward to.
Mar 30, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not you. Not my career. Not my friends. Not a new city, or job. Not anything.
Mar 30, 11:15 PM - Yashmitha: You're good bub. Definitely more gifted than most others. Doesn't mean you're world number one. Especially because you succumb took easily!
Mar 30, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: There's nothing in my life either! I'm in the same place as you are!
Mar 30, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: I'm just keeping myself busy
Mar 30, 11:18 PM - Yashmitha: Going with the flow.. Just to ensure that I'm not depressed
Mar 30, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The one thing that's been making me happy has started to feel like a joke now.
Mar 30, 11:21 PM - Yashmitha: What's that.
Mar 30, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The way I talk to you, and the way you respond makes me feel extremely stupid.
Mar 30, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: You have more serious issues. And you're worried that I don't respond.
Mar 30, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: Where's your career going? What have you planned to do with your life?
Mar 30, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: Don't cry about stupid things!
Mar 30, 11:23 PM - Yashmitha: You were supposed to work hard to ensure that tomorrow goes well. And you don't care anymore.
Mar 30, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just avoid the question.
Mar 30, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Planning my career right now will make me happy? I have to take what makes me happy right now.
Mar 30, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *planning my career will make me happy right now?
Mar 30, 11:25 PM - Yashmitha: That's being stupid
Mar 30, 11:25 PM - Yashmitha: Not planning your career will harm you
Mar 30, 11:25 PM - Yashmitha: It's pretty late already
Mar 30, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who said I haven't planned anything?
Mar 30, 11:26 PM - Yashmitha: Have you made plans for what's not working out?
Mar 30, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You asked to know what's bothering me okay? When I tell you, you tell me that it's stupid.
Mar 30, 11:26 PM - Yashmitha: It is. I'm the one that gets to tell you that..
Mar 30, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's not working out?
Mar 30, 11:27 PM - Yashmitha: I'm the one who's supposed to tell you to stop worrying.. Stop being unhappy
Mar 30, 11:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What makes you think there's no plan?
Mar 30, 11:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's not the problem. The problem is that I honestly don't care anymore.
Mar 30, 11:28 PM - Yashmitha: You just told me you're not excited about anything. Do you have a job in hand?
Mar 30, 11:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No I do not.
Mar 30, 11:29 PM - Yashmitha: Solve those issues.. Set yourself & then see how these things don't matter much?
Mar 30, 11:30 PM - Yashmitha: Win tomorrow. Get a job that excites you. Then you'll see yourself happy.. And then, every relationship will seem better to
Mar 30, 11:30 PM - Yashmitha: *too
Mar 30, 11:30 PM - Yashmitha: Because you'll be happy with yourself. That's the only way to be happy with others
Mar 30, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you showed some interest, I'd be happy.
Mar 30, 11:32 PM - Yashmitha: My life isn't going anywhere. I'm not very keen on pursuing a relationship right now. My mind is definitely elsewhere
Mar 30, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
Mar 30, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: I need to be a little selfish at least.. I need myself to be happy first
Mar 30, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then you shouldn't have dragged me back into this to make yourself feel better about some other bastard.
Mar 30, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: Wtf?
Mar 30, 11:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can deal with any shortcomings when I have someone I can talk to, someone I can lean on. But not like this. Not when it feels like I'm talking to someone who's here because she's being forced to.
Mar 30, 11:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Someone who's here because she feels like she has to or something. That's just sick.
Mar 30, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's irritating. 
For me it's not like "Oh if she's not interested, I'll find some other chick to talk to"
Mar 30, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You make a world of a difference.
Mar 30, 11:36 PM - Yashmitha: Whoever said you can't lean on me?
Mar 30, 11:38 PM - Yashmitha: You know something? I don't give a fuck about people's problems. Never. I don't do that. But to you, I don't turn a blind eye & I always tell you what I think. That's a lot. I genuinely care!
Mar 30, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't lean on you. You don't understand. I never feel like you're truly, genuinely excited about being with or around me. You never make me feel that way.
Mar 30, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm the most private person I know. I can't do it's with anyone but the person this means more than the world to..
Mar 30, 11:39 PM - Yashmitha: I hate when people whine. I really hate it. But I let you complain because I know you need me to listen & I need you to feel better!
Mar 30, 11:40 PM - Yashmitha: And trust me, I don't think I put in effort to be around anyone as much as I do with you
Mar 30, 11:41 PM - Yashmitha: I wouldn't go halfway through the city with anyone coz I felt like it. It's only you 😂
Mar 30, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
Mar 30, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm so tired..
Mar 30, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know sometimes I wish I dropped dead?
Mar 30, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😞
Mar 30, 11:42 PM - Yashmitha: We all do.. Everyone gets sick of everything
Mar 30, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've never felt this before.
Mar 30, 11:42 PM - Yashmitha: But with the right sort of help, you can steer your thoughts chummu
Mar 30, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not about being overwhelmed. It's not about getting sick of things.
Mar 30, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's about the emptiness.
Mar 30, 11:43 PM - Yashmitha: I don't see a problem really.. Sigh. I wish you'd understand my thoughts 😕
Mar 30, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Your thoughts?
Mar 30, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: About what?
Mar 30, 11:44 PM - Yashmitha: About why I'm holding back despite how much I care for you
Mar 30, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why is that re?
Mar 30, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you believe that I want you? Can you think of any time when I was angry or sad that I had to be around you?
Mar 30, 11:45 PM - Yashmitha: I told you. I don't take relationships lightly & if I feel like I can't give my best, I won't take it up in the first place
Mar 30, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For as long as I've known, this makes me instantly happy.
Mar 30, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, I'm confused.
Mar 30, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is this a relationship or isn't it?
Mar 30, 11:47 PM - Yashmitha: I'm confused too
Mar 30, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought you brought it up and I said yes..
Mar 30, 11:47 PM - Yashmitha: I thought I'd give it a shot because you've been wanting it but I don't know if I'm doing anything right
Mar 30, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😂
Mar 30, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're a silly goose.
Mar 30, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Wait, I'll call
Mar 30, 11:48 PM - Yashmitha: Not right now
Mar 30, 11:48 PM - Yashmitha: Sister's up
Mar 30, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Got your laptop back?
Mar 30, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Message me on fb
Mar 30, 11:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Battery low.
Mar 30, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: Okay
Mar 30, 11:50 PM - Yashmitha: And, Nope. I didn't go upstairs to get it
Mar 30, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Does that mean you can't message there?
Mar 30, 11:51 PM - Yashmitha: I can. Unless Whatsapp is easier for you too
Mar 30, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Phone is dying re
Mar 30, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How can I keep messaging?
Mar 30, 11:51 PM - Yashmitha: No charger?
Mar 30, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not right next to my bed is it?
Mar 30, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've seen my room

Mar 31, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what Chummu means?
Mar 31, 9:58 PM - Yashmitha: Small 😝
Mar 31, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It means one who kisses
Mar 31, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like chumma.
Mar 31, 9:58 PM - Yashmitha: Then I'll never be a chummu
Mar 31, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like chumma means kiss
Mar 31, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why?
Mar 31, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: you're a Chummu.
Mar 31, 9:59 PM - Yashmitha: 😂

Mar 31, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummy?
Mar 31, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What you think?

Mar 31, 10:04 PM - Yashmitha: Gimme something from your goodie basket. I'll hit you. 😒
Mar 31, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Mar 31, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What a day it's been
Mar 31, 10:17 PM - Yashmitha: Why the fuck!
Mar 31, 10:17 PM - Yashmitha: That's just pathetic!!
Mar 31, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: I'm sorry.. This terribly sucks

Mar 31, 10:23 PM - Yashmitha: Please call me when you're there. You won't be alone.
Mar 31, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Mar 31, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Exact same scripted response from every college
Mar 31, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what it feels like to get one that says they consider me worthy
Mar 31, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: I guess you were ambitious bub.. Next year it'll be fine no?
Mar 31, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think I was ambitious. Maybe I was ignorant. I thought I had enough, but clearly I missed something.
Mar 31, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: I wish they'd tell you what.
Mar 31, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: Mail them bub
Mar 31, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: See what could have been better
Mar 31, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They don't tell
Mar 31, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Mar 31, 10:44 PM - Yashmitha: They apparently do bub
Mar 31, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who's asked?
Mar 31, 10:44 PM - Yashmitha: Ooooh😍
Mar 31, 10:44 PM - Yashmitha: I saw on that Facebook group
Mar 31, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Mar 31, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who asked which college re?
Mar 31, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What was said?
Mar 31, 10:46 PM - Yashmitha: Something. I don't remember bub
Mar 31, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What exactly to ask re?
Mar 31, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How to broach the topic?
Mar 31, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Say you were really looking for admissions there & that you'd like to reapply or something so you wanna know what you can improve
Mar 31, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Thank you very much for giving my application for graduate education in the Computer Science and Engineering Program your full consideration. 

While I understand that the sheer number of quality applicants means some applicants must lose out, I was very keen on pursuing education at the University of Michigan. It would be extremely helpful if you could help me identify the shortcomings in my application so I can better orient myself in the future.
Mar 31, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: Perfect.
Mar 31, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: Add kindly oblige or something at the end
Mar 31, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: 😋
Mar 31, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay :)
Mar 31, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Missy. I want you. Kindly oblige.
Mar 31, 11:00 PM - Yashmitha: 😂
Mar 31, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fast!
Mar 31, 11:00 PM - Yashmitha: I'd never be this hard on you in the first page
Mar 31, 11:00 PM - Yashmitha: *place
Mar 31, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This hard?
Mar 31, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't understand
Mar 31, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: As has as the Universities are being
Mar 31, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: *hard
Mar 31, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh. They're okay re
Mar 31, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't help it no?
Mar 31, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because you know me, you're outraged. But they have to work through 1000+ applications. How to make everyone happy?
Mar 31, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They have to do the best they can. The best, based on prior experience and on something that indicates a sure sign of success. BMS doesn't scream success at anyone :(
Mar 31, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: You should have gotten an LOR from Pai's brother
Mar 31, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: Would it help?
Mar 31, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it doesn't matter. I'm determined to succeed. It'll happen for me.
Mar 31, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: It will.
Mar 31, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I doubt it re. The thing is, people have to know and vouch for you. Pai's brother can't claim that he's worked with me on anything!
Mar 31, 11:06 PM - Yashmitha: He could have no?
Mar 31, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How re? He stays in stanford. He hasn't really done something here in India. How could I have worked with him on something?
Mar 31, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: Ah
Mar 31, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: BRB
Mar 31, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: I should sleep bub
Mar 31, 11:17 PM - Yashmitha: Sakshi wants to run tomorrow

Apr 1, 12:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re.. Actually they're pretty old shows
Apr 1, 12:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The people on the internet, the ones that share this stuff, don't keep sharing these sort of shows
Apr 1, 12:07 PM - Yashmitha: Oh
Apr 1, 12:07 PM - Yashmitha: Then what should I watch after suits?
Apr 1, 12:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I won't be able to get all of it. The recent stuff, for sure. But anything older than 3-4 years is hard.
Apr 1, 12:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, remember how back in the day movies and videos and tv shows used to be really big? The file sizes? No one's gone back to these shows and made them smaller. So its a 5GB+ download for one season

Apr 1, 12:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She also likes someone, but in the end she likes someone else.
Apr 1, 12:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: People get married and people break up.
Apr 1, 12:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: People die and people come back from the dead.
Apr 1, 12:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All this while people in the college keep getting messages from "Gossip Girl" about rumours and other gossip.
Apr 1, 12:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In the end they find out who gossip girl is.

Apr 10, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: Actually, no. Her face gives the impression that she's thin. Usually
Apr 10, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In this case her face also doesn't but
Apr 10, 11:15 PM - Yashmitha: It does re

Apr 10, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's tough, from VTU colleges :(
Apr 10, 11:21 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Apr 10, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: TAMU, not that bad but GaTech yes.
Apr 10, 11:23 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah.. Shit re
Apr 10, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's tough. That's the way it is.. But that's what makes me want it more
Apr 10, 11:26 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly.. Shit I really thought this was easy
Apr 10, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not that hard. Just depends on how lofty your ambitions are. 
But your profile is good re. I know you'll get through.
Apr 10, 11:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've done work in industry, there's one paper, and decent grades. Can't ask for more than that
Apr 10, 11:36 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm..
Apr 10, 11:36 PM - Yashmitha: I need Rutgers
Apr 10, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want you to get in Texas. It's cheaper and it's better right now. More chances.

Apr 11, 5:38 PM - Yashmitha: Hi re
Apr 11, 5:38 PM - Yashmitha: So I just came back
Apr 11, 5:39 PM - Yashmitha: But I'm going to college now for red bull tour bus even though I have no idea who's playing. Lol
Apr 11, 5:39 PM - Yashmitha: I'll text when I can
Apr 11, 5:39 PM - Yashmitha: You're at mass?
Apr 11, 5:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're such a loser. Won't even call me.
Apr 11, 5:41 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Do you have anyone to come with?
Apr 11, 5:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No. Obviously not.
Apr 11, 5:43 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Apr 11, 5:43 PM - Yashmitha: What are you annoyed for now
Apr 11, 5:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Piss off.
Apr 11, 5:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't want me to be a part of anything.
Apr 11, 10:59 PM - Yashmitha: Hi
Apr 11, 10:59 PM - Yashmitha: That's not true.
Apr 11, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Apr 11, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: Did the tour bus get cancelled in your college?
Apr 11, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: A part of it.
Apr 11, 11:06 PM - Yashmitha: The whole thing didn't happen 😝
Apr 11, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: In ours
Apr 11, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: Rained too much
Apr 11, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Apr 11, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They were probably covered no?

Apr 11, 11:32 PM - Yashmitha: My butt hurts
Apr 11, 11:32 PM - Yashmitha: From all the riding
Apr 11, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The few occasions that you get to stay out and be out late, you use up without me
Apr 11, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like that
Apr 11, 11:36 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Apr 11, 11:36 PM - Yashmitha: What do I say to that
Apr 11, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing.. Don't say anything.
Apr 11, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm tired.. Good night
Apr 11, 11:42 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Apr 12, 11:05 AM - Yashmitha: Good morning..
Apr 12, 11:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Morning
Apr 12, 11:57 AM - Yashmitha: Tamu reject
Apr 12, 11:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: :l
Apr 12, 11:58 AM - Yashmitha: No hope. Rutgers I really need
Apr 12, 11:58 AM - Yashmitha: Otherwise no point going
Apr 12, 11:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Texas Tech p
Apr 12, 11:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: ?
Apr 12, 11:59 AM - Yashmitha: I don't think I'll go there and all
Apr 12, 12:00 PM - Yashmitha: It's apparently a C grade University
Apr 12, 12:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Really?
Apr 12, 12:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :(
Apr 12, 12:03 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah..
Apr 12, 12:03 PM - Yashmitha: It doesn't even feature anywhere
Apr 12, 12:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, tell me what else is left
Apr 12, 12:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's gone is gone. Forget about it.
Apr 12, 12:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I went and met a former neighbor of mine who used to work at IISc.
Apr 12, 12:37 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm.. I might need help to go and get an internship there re
Apr 12, 12:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm trying some things
Apr 12, 12:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm keeping my fingers crossed for IBM research
Apr 12, 12:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Small chance that I might get to intern there.
Apr 12, 12:46 PM - Yashmitha: Tell me after it's done sweetie pie
Apr 12, 12:46 PM - Yashmitha: I'm sick of bad news
Apr 12, 12:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww :(
Apr 12, 12:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me re. What other place is left?
Apr 12, 12:47 PM - Yashmitha: Rutgers! U Houston!
Apr 12, 12:47 PM - Yashmitha: I want Rutgers so bad!
Apr 12, 12:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 12, 12:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Everyone's sharing this
Apr 12, 12:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You should get Rutgers. I'm pretty sure.
Apr 12, 12:49 PM - Yashmitha: Shoo 😝
Apr 12, 12:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Let me tell you something. The world isn't what it used to be. There are enough and more opportunities. Life expectancy is up. It's not like a hundred years ago when people died at 45-50. A career is extremely long.
Apr 12, 12:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One year means pretty much nothing in my opinion.
Apr 12, 12:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what I'm telling myself.
Apr 12, 12:52 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe.. Sweetheart. One year means a lot when you're supposed to get married in three or four. You'd want a good life for your parents and yourself before that.
Apr 12, 1:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Life can change overnight. There's no substitute for education.
Apr 12, 1:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know it might seem like marriage is a big deal, but eventually people need to understand that that's not all there is to life!
Apr 12, 1:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's ambition and the desire to make a name for yourself.
Apr 12, 1:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't let people control your life, that's all I'm saying <>
Apr 12, 1:08 PM - Yashmitha: I don't even want to be married. It's so pointless unless you find the perfect person. Rubbish
Apr 12, 1:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That, I agree with
Apr 12, 1:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't need someone to protect you, provide for you, all of that stuff. Not anymore.
Apr 12, 1:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't need to be married to find company or even to put a roof over your head.
Apr 12, 1:10 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly!
Apr 12, 1:11 PM - Yashmitha: It's rubbish. All I want to do is be rich. 😐
Apr 12, 1:11 PM - Yashmitha: I'd rather make money and help someone who already exists and is facing problems coz of lack of funds
Apr 12, 1:11 PM - Yashmitha: Than make more people 😐
Apr 12, 1:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think it's your right to decide
Apr 12, 1:12 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know. All I want right now is a good University
Apr 12, 1:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm.
Apr 12, 2:34 PM - Yashmitha: Sigh
Apr 12, 4:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😘
Apr 12, 4:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <<<>>

Apr 12, 9:10 PM - Yashmitha: How much money got deducted? Check & tell
Apr 12, 9:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You got twice?
Apr 12, 9:10 PM - Yashmitha: Coz the recharge happened twice it seems.
Apr 12, 9:10 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Apr 12, 9:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: First time it didn't work so I tried again.
Apr 12, 9:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay re
Apr 12, 9:13 PM - Yashmitha: Everything you try will work, even if it doesn't the first time 😘
Apr 12, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're going to shimoga 😢
Apr 12, 9:23 PM - Yashmitha: No sweetheart
Apr 12, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You told me you're going no?
Apr 12, 9:23 PM - Yashmitha: Was supposed to

Apr 12, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Watch this, you'll feel better
Apr 12, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: I've seen it. Hehe 😄
Apr 12, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's nice no?
Apr 12, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me what's troubling you :)
Apr 12, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: I'm going to sleep now bub. Nothing, this admission scene
Apr 12, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: And project scene. Those guys aren't very cooperative
Apr 12, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Good night sweetie
Apr 12, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who guys?
Apr 12, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Love you
Apr 12, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Shimoga people?
Apr 12, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Shayak & Ajay
Apr 12, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh :(
I love you too. Everything will be alright :*
Apr 12, 10:49 PM - Yashmitha: 😘
Apr 13, 10:20 AM - Yashmitha: Good morning sweetheart
Apr 13, 10:20 AM - Yashmitha: Such a bad day already 😕
Apr 13, 10:20 AM - Yashmitha: I'm not feeling positive about anything
Apr 13, 10:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What happened today re?
Apr 13, 10:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't let yourself be down!
Apr 13, 10:37 AM - Yashmitha: Nothing happened. I'm just extremely disheartened..
Apr 13, 10:37 AM - Yashmitha: Can you help
Apr 13, 10:37 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Everything can be turned around
Apr 13, 10:37 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How do I help?
Apr 13, 10:38 AM - Yashmitha: I think I should start applying for jobs.. Pharma, oil & gas. Anything. Help me get started please
Apr 13, 10:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Research will help?
Apr 13, 10:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The best thing to do is to talk to a prof in college who has contacts in IISc.
Apr 13, 10:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: One girl from chemical in BMS did that last time. She got into CMU
Apr 13, 10:40 AM - Yashmitha: As in she worked in IISc first?
Apr 13, 10:40 AM - Sonal Saldanha: As in she spent a year doing research
Apr 13, 10:41 AM - Yashmitha: That's amazing
Apr 13, 10:41 AM - Yashmitha: I'll talk to Shareef Sir
Apr 13, 10:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't even matter if you're working for free.
Apr 13, 10:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That sort of recommendation is priceless.
Apr 13, 10:42 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah! It is!
Apr 13, 10:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I personally feel like this December is too soon to do anything of significance..
Apr 13, 10:45 AM - Yashmitha: Doesn't matter re. Really doesn't. Maybe for you, not for me
Apr 13, 10:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you mean?
Apr 13, 10:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Of course it matters! There's no point working so hard at IISc if you're aiming low. IISc offsets everything! Marks, GRE, toefl, everything.
Apr 13, 10:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It changes your CV, it changes your recommendations
Apr 13, 10:49 AM - Yashmitha: I'm saying that six months is not bad at IISc
Apr 13, 10:51 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But you have to be able to complete something I'm saying
Apr 13, 10:51 AM - Sonal Saldanha: A project, a paper
Apr 13, 10:52 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Six months of familiarity before someone recommends isn't very very strong
Apr 13, 10:52 AM - Yashmitha: What do I do 😪😪
Apr 13, 11:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Why'd you call?
Apr 13, 11:17 AM - Yashmitha: Gimme Arabian dates if you have at home 😛
Apr 13, 11:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Aiyyo
Apr 13, 11:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll give you NE.
Apr 13, 11:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: *Me
Apr 13, 11:17 AM - Yashmitha: Gimme dates. Kthanksbye.
Apr 13, 9:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hi Bob.
Apr 13, 9:42 PM - Yashmitha: Hello re
Apr 13, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hiee

Apr 13, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Online, some business quiz
Apr 13, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're feeling better?
Apr 13, 10:09 PM - Yashmitha: No re
Apr 13, 10:09 PM - Yashmitha: Nonsense
Apr 13, 10:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why not sweetie? Why's it so bad this time?
Apr 13, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: Lol.. Heat issues
Apr 13, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: Simmer
Apr 13, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: *summer
Apr 13, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Someone we know is getting 331 on the jee mains
Apr 13, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm. No more heat issues. It became so cold suddenly!
Apr 13, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who someone?
Apr 13, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: Chirag
Apr 13, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: My sister's lifetime crush 😝
Apr 13, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chirag?
Apr 13, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That doctor's son guy?
Apr 13, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah! 😄
Apr 13, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Apr 13, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nice 😊
Apr 13, 10:27 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe.. Crazy no? IIT it is!
Apr 13, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re, you need a JEE Advanced score for IIT
Apr 13, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This is only for NIT
Apr 13, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: Oh yeah. Still. It's crazy
Apr 13, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's really really good
Apr 13, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly. Damn!
Apr 13, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chummu 😘
Apr 13, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I miss you. It's been too long!
Apr 13, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: I feel purposeless..
Apr 13, 10:34 PM - Yashmitha: Shit.. Chirag is getting a score I couldn't even get on my gre 😕
Apr 13, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Shoo.
Apr 13, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You won't think about all that right now.
Apr 13, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you want to be successful, you will find a way. Crying over what has passed doesn't help you get there no?
Apr 13, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <>
Apr 13, 10:38 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm but it's still insane
Apr 13, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What is insane?
Apr 13, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: His score?
Apr 13, 10:39 PM - Yashmitha: That score and the fact that someone we know is doing that well
Apr 13, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It should only serve to motivate you to do better :)
Apr 13, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: To show that you can be just as successful despite not going to NIT or IIT
Apr 13, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: Lol.. Yeah re
Apr 13, 10:42 PM - Yashmitha: What you doing?
Apr 13, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 13, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This picture reminds me of Clement.
Apr 13, 10:42 PM - Yashmitha: Why?
Apr 13, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I look like him in this
Apr 13, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: Hahaha who took it?
Apr 13, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Manika I think. I don't remember.
Apr 13, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: See? Such difficult hair
Apr 13, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: I love the hair
Apr 13, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 13, 10:45 PM - Yashmitha: You look like an egg. Awwww.
Apr 13, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Eh.
Apr 13, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What sort of eggs have you been eating missy?
Apr 13, 10:45 PM - Yashmitha: Bub you want to take me to Haagen Dazs?😝
Apr 13, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are they even chicken eggs?
Apr 13, 10:45 PM - Yashmitha: Easter egg! 😄
Apr 13, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😣
Apr 13, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No bub, I don't want to take you anywhere
Apr 13, 10:46 PM - Yashmitha: It's only 2k for a Sundae! Why won't you take me?
Apr 13, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because you won't take me home
Apr 13, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Come come. Meet my dad 😝

And now that I know what you're going through, it's made my opinion even stronger. I know that there's nothing I can say that'll take away the pain, but I'm sure knowing that you're loved will be comforting. I have immense respect for your spirit. May you be blessed in abundance, always and may you eventually find your solace in something that makes you extremely happy, well deservedly. And more than anything, I hope you always have the courage to live each new day with hope in your heart and peace in your mind.. God bless you and your family, take care ❤"

Apr 25, 7:08 PM - Yashmitha: Why??
Apr 25, 7:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Stupid traffic
Apr 25, 7:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't even see a reason for the traffic.
Apr 25, 7:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like someone went to the signals and messed them up.
Apr 25, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're one pumpkin. So cute in those pictures :*
Apr 25, 7:40 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe.. Thanks bub 😝
Apr 25, 7:40 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah! Rain ruins everything!
Apr 25, 7:40 PM - Yashmitha: Bangalore isn't equipped
Apr 25, 7:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay when I'm at home.
Apr 25, 7:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why the hell does it rain when I'm outside?
Apr 25, 7:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I had plans of going to PlanB and all! 😡
Apr 25, 7:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Today I gave a constable a drop. Nanjappa. 😬
Apr 25, 7:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We were bonding.
Apr 25, 7:42 PM - Yashmitha: PlanB with whom? 😁
Apr 25, 7:42 PM - Yashmitha: Oho! Coorgi?
Apr 25, 7:43 PM - Yashmitha: Why did you drop? He asked?
Apr 25, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some guy re. I didn't ask where he's from.
Apr 25, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He was asking people but no one was stopping.
Apr 25, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I stopped.
Apr 25, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One old man.
Apr 25, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: PlanB with someone and all. 😏
Apr 25, 7:44 PM - Yashmitha: So sad re. So sweet you are.. Till where you dropped?
Apr 25, 7:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Till college. He stays somewhere close to college.
Apr 25, 7:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He didn't have teeth in front! Only one tooth was there.
Apr 25, 7:45 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe 😁
Apr 25, 7:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Being a cop in India is pointless. It's a stupid job.
Apr 25, 7:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what this country needs?
Apr 25, 7:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It needs to reward administration. It needs to make people want to be in an administrative post.
Apr 25, 7:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And not just for some job security and all that nonsense.
Apr 25, 7:47 PM - Yashmitha: So very true! They need to start feeling wanted!
Apr 25, 7:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not just wanted. It should be a job that they're proud of. Something that people want to get into.
Apr 25, 7:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like there's pride in being a cop abroad. You can pull people up. Make detective. Make Sergent. Actually solve crimes.
Apr 25, 7:49 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly. They should really start doing that. They should even start recruiting the hot ones & give them a sexy uniform 😋
Apr 25, 7:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chee.
Apr 25, 7:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Those things really disappoint me about India re. It's a horrible place to live in. People don't give a damn about rules.
Apr 25, 7:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All of us don't. You, me included.
Apr 25, 7:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd we go somewhere else, we treat the place better than they do
Apr 25, 7:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *if
Apr 25, 7:58 PM - Yashmitha: Bub I'm talking to a senior about IISc, please hold on
Apr 25, 7:58 PM - Yashmitha: I love you
Apr 25, 7:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay little one 😘
Apr 25, 8:11 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 8:11 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 8:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I also need something like this :(
Apr 25, 8:12 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 8:14 PM - Yashmitha: I hope you get something too bub.. Please try talking to seniors who have worked!
Apr 25, 8:14 PM - Yashmitha: And this is in Chitradurga.. And the prof wants someone who will work for a year!
Apr 25, 8:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 200km from here
Apr 25, 8:16 PM - Yashmitha: One year bub
Apr 25, 8:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Madness
Apr 25, 8:17 PM - Yashmitha: I want to apply for spring no?
Apr 25, 8:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But after that, life set.
Apr 25, 8:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm telling you, it's worth it
Apr 25, 8:17 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm?
Apr 25, 8:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can take your pick of colleges. Any place you want.
Apr 25, 8:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Look up the professor on scholar.google.com
Apr 25, 8:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If he's got a profile and lots of publications then he's bound to personally know people in departments abroad.
Apr 25, 8:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That connection is all you need. It's like getting into IISc because you know someone. You walk right in. That's what happened with swati. I'm sure her IISc guide knew someone at Cornell.
Apr 25, 8:21 PM - Yashmitha: My mom's unhappy about that re.. She doesn't want me to take a whole year off & neither do I
Apr 25, 8:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But think about it. You're not going to finish a full project anywhere before 8 months minimum.
Apr 25, 8:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the term for RAship also
Apr 25, 8:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They won't take you on for 3-4 months sweetheart.
Apr 25, 8:25 PM - Yashmitha: Shit I'm so screwed
Apr 25, 8:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not screwed. Talk to anyone about US and all they'll tell you is that the job and the pay are amazing. The better the school, the better it gets.
Apr 25, 8:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One year is nothing when you think of the big picture.
Apr 25, 8:26 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm.. Okay bub
Apr 25, 8:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Explain the same thing at home. You can give your family financial stability like nothing else can.
Apr 25, 8:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: People manage to pay off the entire loan and save also in their first year of work. Unimaginable stuff.
Apr 25, 8:27 PM - Yashmitha: Crazy crazy
Apr 25, 8:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Think of this one year as part of the MS only. It's like the mvj period. After one year you go to the Ramaiah equivalent.
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Yashmitha: Bub? Swathi worked in IISc for two months no? 😕
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's been working since September.
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Contracted till April.
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Yashmitha: How??
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Yashmitha: They allow that?
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She went and begged. Don't know how it happened.
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Yashmitha: That is crazy. Where did she get an admit?
Apr 25, 8:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The prof was nice enough to take them, that's all
Apr 25, 8:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Cornell
Apr 25, 8:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: USC
Apr 25, 8:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't know about the others. She applied to Michigan and CMU also.
Apr 25, 8:29 PM - Yashmitha: Crazy.. Really. Cornell 😍
Apr 25, 8:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Must've got.
Apr 25, 8:29 PM - Yashmitha: She's a 9 pointer?
Apr 25, 8:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. One of their toppers.
Apr 25, 8:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Her HOD and all really like her apparently.
Apr 25, 8:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The recommendations must have been strong.
Apr 25, 8:32 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo. I'll ask Adarsh where all he got 😛
Apr 25, 8:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ask if someone knows CS people also?
Apr 25, 8:34 PM - Yashmitha: Bub.. Ask the CS hod. Trust me. I went to mine today
Apr 25, 8:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: BMS people are shit re..
Apr 25, 8:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Seriously
Apr 25, 8:35 PM - Yashmitha: I'll try asking
Apr 25, 8:35 PM - Yashmitha: You also do so, meanwhile. Don't procrastinate
Apr 25, 8:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm asking other people.
Apr 25, 8:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Microsoft, IBM, IISc.
Apr 25, 8:37 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. Keep getting in touch. Don't leave the library person also. We'll go back on Monday
Apr 25, 8:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't sweetu. I have that stupid internal review. Have to meet and get a guide recommendation, submit report and all.
Apr 25, 8:41 PM - Yashmitha: Then Tuesday
Apr 25, 8:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hopefully. This week anything can come up.
Apr 25, 8:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Messed up it is right now.
Apr 25, 8:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you no? We don't have anything concrete in terms of a project.
Apr 25, 8:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Have to work doubly hard on report and presentation. Have to trick the guide and all, making it seem like we've done a lot.
Apr 25, 8:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's really really high up in the IBM hierarchy.
Apr 25, 8:47 PM - Yashmitha: You know him personally?
Apr 25, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can walk into an IBM job tomorrow if I wanted to.
Apr 25, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But research is a different division.
Apr 25, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yep. He really likes me. Wrote me a recommendation also.
Apr 25, 8:49 PM - Yashmitha: Touch wood
Apr 25, 8:49 PM - Yashmitha: Get the IBM one only sweetu!
Apr 25, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't choose till I know there's something there for me to.
Apr 25, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *Re
Apr 25, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's like counting chickens before they hatch.
Apr 25, 8:51 PM - Yashmitha: True.. Let's hope it's all good bub
Apr 25, 8:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fingers crossed
Apr 25, 8:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You heard about Nepal?
Apr 25, 9:05 PM - Yashmitha: Earthquake no? 😕
Apr 25, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's really sad.
Apr 25, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nowhere to run it something that strong hits.
Apr 25, 9:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 80 years ago Nepal had one, 10500 fatalities.
Apr 25, 9:44 PM - Yashmitha: Bub!
Apr 25, 9:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes?
Apr 25, 9:46 PM - Yashmitha: Oh my gosh. I need to tell you something.. About the senior I was talking to
Apr 25, 9:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me
Apr 25, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 9:49 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What I told you he told you
Apr 25, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's reality re. When you work for a year, they know you're serious.
Apr 25, 9:52 PM - Yashmitha: Insane.
Apr 25, 9:52 PM - Yashmitha: Absolutely.
Apr 25, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Delft is classy apparently.
Apr 25, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Netherlands.
Apr 25, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: CMU is good, but at the price you can do better.
Apr 25, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The thing with chemical is, there's huge chances of success all over Europe.
Apr 25, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 54000 a year is madness!
Apr 25, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's more than 4000 a month!
Apr 25, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I somehow don't believe that missy. Maybe he added an extra 0?
Apr 25, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's PhD level funding.
Apr 25, 10:01 PM - Yashmitha: Idk re. He added the extra H though. Lol
Apr 25, 10:01 PM - Yashmitha: He's talking about UTA
Apr 25, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: UTA is one of my dreams.
Apr 25, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Amazing place, Austin. It's got the right vibe. Small city, cheap, vibrant, good rock scene, nice food and startup hub.
Apr 25, 10:02 PM - Yashmitha: I know sweetheart.. We'll make it real
Apr 25, 10:02 PM - Yashmitha: Dammit
Apr 25, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What re?

Apr 25, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It'll take up too much of her life re
Apr 25, 10:06 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm
Apr 25, 10:07 PM - Yashmitha: Let's see. God is kind.
Apr 25, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes he is 😊
Apr 25, 10:08 PM - Yashmitha: :) We will chase our dreams. We will make them come true. Don't you worry, my dear
Apr 25, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :*
Apr 25, 10:23 PM - Yashmitha: I want CMU now 😝
Apr 25, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently the dean of admissions at Seattle is an Indian.
Apr 25, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Lots of Indians got in this year.
Apr 25, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: Seattle?
Apr 25, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Same reason why people get USC every year.
Apr 25, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: UW Seattle re
Apr 25, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Oh crazy. Tamu also should get an Indian Dean 😝
Apr 25, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re. Besides the price it's not that great.
Apr 25, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's honestly the only thing that gravitates people towards College Station.
Apr 25, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah? Oh okay
Apr 25, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: Bub next time when I apply, I can do so in Purdue & all no?
Apr 25, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes. The guide you work under will have an opinion about that
Apr 25, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He'll know where to go and what's best
Apr 25, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm..

Apr 26, 1:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sorry, but that's a problem. And I'm not going to pretend like it doesn't bother me. I like you, I like being around you, but that means nothing to you. That part sucks.

Apr 26, 1:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: None of your plans, your bucket lists and dreams and all are with me. 
Sometimes I question whether this is worth anything at all to you.

Apr 27, 8:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You never show any interest in me.
Apr 27, 8:37 PM - Yashmitha: Okay. This is really weird
Apr 27, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah it is. You're such a bitch.
Apr 27, 8:53 PM - Yashmitha: You have too many insecurities.
Apr 27, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why don't you ever make me feel nice?
Apr 27, 8:53 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not supposed to call someone hot? Grow up a little.
Apr 27, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's always about some other guy.
Apr 27, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Call someone hot. But what about me?
Apr 27, 8:54 PM - Yashmitha: Because you're not my guy anymore. I don't have to be the one telling you anything. Just go find someone else to help your case. Irritating. I can't do that job.
Apr 27, 8:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know whether it makes a difference to you, but I'm always going on about how you're so attractive. And I obviously mean it. It'd be nice to hear it back from you.
Apr 27, 8:55 PM - Yashmitha: I call you good looking too! What shit?
Apr 27, 8:57 PM - Yashmitha: You're just finding reasons now. I'm obviously not hopelessly attracted like I used to be because for me, that part of our story is over and it always will be. I'll find you attractive & I'll always really like your company & I'll need you & be there for you but more like your friend that anything else.. I just can't go back re. It feels wrong to me
Apr 27, 8:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't go back to what?
Apr 27, 8:58 PM - Yashmitha: To being us. You're not easy at all. No relationship is.. I don't feel like investing that much. 😕
Apr 27, 8:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just strung me along then?
Apr 27, 9:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're one horrible creature. Keep changing your mind from day to day. "okay, let's go out", "no, I'm not up for it anymore"
Apr 27, 9:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fuck you. Who does that?
Apr 27, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like it's some sort of prank!
Apr 27, 9:01 PM - Yashmitha: Well, I sometimes feel like I should give this another go, but most times it feels like there's a clock attached to this & I feel like, what am I doing?
Apr 27, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd like to punch you really hard at the moment.
Apr 27, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I mean that.
Apr 27, 9:01 PM - Yashmitha: I told you re. You should let this be without strings.. I'm serious. Something light, not something so serious that'll mess you up
Apr 27, 9:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You think I'd harp about you not meeting me and not talking to me and that sort of shit if I thought this wasn't anything?
Apr 27, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There are no strings. I want you, I think you want me. That's all there is to it.
Apr 27, 9:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At least for me. I'm not asking you to renounce the world, run away with me and get married,  never look back.
Apr 27, 9:04 PM - Yashmitha: Why can't we just be friends 😣
Apr 27, 9:04 PM - Yashmitha: So much easier to hang out then!!
Apr 27, 9:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd rather not know you at all. It's just grief.
Apr 27, 9:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sucks.
Apr 27, 9:05 PM - Yashmitha: Okay.. That's one way if it helps you. But it's grief too. Trust me.
Apr 27, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Here I am, all I care about is you. About being happy, with you.
Apr 27, 9:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hate you so much right now.
Apr 27, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: I don't want to date bub. I don't want to commit. But I don't want you to be non existent to me.
Apr 27, 9:26 PM - Yashmitha: Why can't we just be? Like without expectations or anything. Not really putting a tag on this
Apr 27, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You just want to flirt with everyone and have a good time.
Apr 27, 9:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We can. But you won't even do that. If I want to kiss you, because I really do want to kiss you, I can't. Why? Because there's no tag. If I want to be around you, you'll ask me why. And I can't hold you to anything. Because there's no tag.
Apr 27, 9:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The no tag thing, it's just an excuse for you to get everything you want without giving anything in return.
Apr 27, 9:37 PM - Yashmitha: You can actually kiss 😛 outside of a tag. Why not? 😛
Apr 27, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Wth are you saying?
Apr 27, 9:40 PM - Yashmitha: You're not open to being friends with benefits? 😝
Apr 27, 9:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You are?
Apr 27, 9:42 PM - Yashmitha: I have no issues with it actually 😝
Apr 27, 9:43 PM - Yashmitha: But usually the girl gets too attached. Here I think it's the other way round
Apr 27, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I really don't buy that..
Apr 27, 9:50 PM - Yashmitha: Don't buy what?
Apr 27, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't sound like you
Apr 27, 9:52 PM - Yashmitha: Don't be judgy 😝
Apr 27, 9:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How many of these things do you have ongoing already?
Apr 27, 9:54 PM - Yashmitha: 😳
Apr 27, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😝
Apr 27, 9:54 PM - Yashmitha: Why are you like this bub? So retarded
Apr 27, 9:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What? Out of the blue you say all this, I know you discuss this with others, it's a fair assumption.
Apr 27, 9:55 PM - Yashmitha: Fuck you? 😝
Apr 27, 9:55 PM - Yashmitha: Irritating fellow
Apr 27, 9:55 PM - Yashmitha: Uff!
Apr 27, 9:55 PM - Yashmitha: Mojo didn't come?
Apr 27, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, so what're you saying now?
Apr 27, 9:57 PM - Yashmitha: Nothing I'm saying
Apr 27, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you serious about this?
Apr 27, 10:00 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not sure. I've never really tried it 😂
Apr 27, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't care about being in a "relationship", I don't care about the tag. I just care about being with you. Being able to express how I feel.
Apr 27, 10:05 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah.. This is funny 😛
Apr 27, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What Yeah?
Apr 27, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm still worried this is all a joke.
Apr 27, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or that tomorrow you'll say this never happened. :/
Apr 27, 10:09 PM - Yashmitha: I'm unsure of how it'll turn out re. Lol
Apr 27, 10:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think I know.. You'll fivew up
Apr 27, 10:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *Give
Apr 27, 10:13 PM - Yashmitha: Give up on what?
Apr 27, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. Whatever this is going to be
Apr 27, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to know something..
Apr 27, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm?
Apr 27, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Does being around me get you excited?
Apr 27, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because it drives me mad.
Apr 27, 10:18 PM - Yashmitha: Haha! That used to be me! 😝
Apr 27, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me no?
Apr 27, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now?

Apr 27, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I get very disappointed by girls that aren't willing to take care of themselves..
Apr 27, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Only girls?
Apr 27, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: That's so sexist 😛

Apr 29, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or that some things that you expected to do could not happen because of industry constrants.

Apr 30, 10:56 AM - Yashmitha: What Nonsense? 😋
Apr 30, 10:56 AM - Yashmitha: Sin it seems. You're a sin.
Apr 30, 11:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sinful.
Apr 30, 11:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But you can't resist.
Apr 30, 11:24 AM - Yashmitha: I shouldn't

Apr 30, 6:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: On the flyover one light pole had fallen on a bus!
Apr 30, 6:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The bus couldn't move. Then it started raining.
Apr 30, 6:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I collided head on with an auto at mayo hall.
Apr 30, 6:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then twice I didn't see giant stones, went over them and almost fell over.

Anyway, that's a very difficult exerciser.
Apr 30, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I want to master it.
Apr 30, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So that's why I'm tired today. Couldn't sleep in the afternoon coz I was in college.
Apr 30, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's too weird no? Who stays at someone's place for more than a night? :/ it's unnatural.
Apr 30, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you going to run off now or can you stay and text?
Apr 30, 10:47 PM - Yashmitha: I can text in between
Apr 30, 10:47 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah it's weird
Apr 30, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: And very irritating
Apr 30, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ask them if they're not leaving

Apr 30, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. You would
Apr 30, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I would.

May 1, 12:09 PM - Yashmitha: I stopped thinking about it
May 1, 12:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
May 1, 12:38 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. I'm not cut out for this really. I make horrible decisions
May 1, 12:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Cut out for what?
May 1, 12:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're cut out for me 😘
May 1, 12:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Missy? You should start selling off gold. Prices have started to fall steadily.
May 1, 1:04 PM - Yashmitha: Selling gold or buying fool??
May 1, 1:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aye mad person. It's going to keep falling.
May 1, 1:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what I'm saying.
May 1, 1:21 PM - Yashmitha: Oh so it's good no? We can buy. Price may go down. Value won't 😛
May 1, 1:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😣
May 1, 1:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I give up.
May 1, 1:38 PM - Yashmitha: Bub..
May 1, 1:38 PM - Yashmitha: Remember how I was really sad college is ending.
May 1, 1:39 PM - Yashmitha: Now I'm not.. I think God knew it would be hard on me & he let me know a few truths about the people I thought really liked me
May 1, 1:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the matter little one?
May 1, 1:39 PM - Yashmitha: I found out a lot of truths yesterday
May 1, 1:39 PM - Yashmitha: And now I'm extremely disappointed.. For trusting people and letting myself believe that this world is a lovely place
May 1, 1:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What happened?
May 1, 1:40 PM - Yashmitha: You know Ayisha no?
May 1, 1:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah
May 1, 1:41 PM - Yashmitha: She keeps saying bangaloreans are extremely fake and that she doesn't like the place.. She says it's hard for her to believe that people sweetly smile to each other & behind their backs they don't like them
May 1, 1:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She says that about you?
May 1, 1:41 PM - Yashmitha: She's a hypocrite
May 1, 1:41 PM - Yashmitha: And a bitch at that.
May 1, 1:42 PM - Yashmitha: She's gone and told Shayak so much shit about me.. And that asshole even believed her. And he also pretended the whole time to like the person that I am.. And I thought they both genuinely did
May 1, 1:42 PM - Yashmitha: Fuck.. I'm so heartbroken that I let myself trust anyone
May 1, 1:42 PM - Yashmitha: Wtf
May 1, 1:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <>
May 1, 1:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Screw them all. The world is like that.
May 1, 1:43 PM - Yashmitha: Why do I always get screwed over? :/
May 1, 1:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you really want me to tell you re?
May 1, 1:44 PM - Yashmitha: Tell me the truth
May 1, 1:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know how you are? When you're with people, people you think are your friends, you forget about everyone else. You forget about me, you forget about family. You even abuse me.
May 1, 1:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They make you feel invincible or something.
May 1, 1:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You just put too much faith in them.
May 1, 1:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Despite not really knowing who or what they are.
May 1, 1:46 PM - Yashmitha: That's just me having fun.. What faith is in the picture?
May 1, 1:46 PM - Yashmitha: Oh
May 1, 1:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why do you think I keep away from people? People are sick. They're selfish and they won't think about you twice.
May 1, 1:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's very very few that might like you. And among those, there are fewer that you can count on. 
Everyone else just uses others and never gives back.
May 1, 1:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not the only one that gets screwed over. Everyone that I've really liked has screwed me over too. Almost everyone.
May 1, 1:52 PM - Yashmitha: I really need to learn a lesson
May 1, 1:52 PM - Yashmitha: I keep saying this all the time but I don't learn
May 1, 1:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's ironic how you dismiss me for everyone else and in the end you come and tell me this :P
May 1, 1:54 PM - Yashmitha: You are free to walk away.
May 1, 1:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Amm amm :*
May 1, 1:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not going anywhere <>
May 1, 1:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You want to talk?
May 1, 1:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's been a while.
May 1, 1:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Would you rather meet instead?
May 1, 1:55 PM - Yashmitha: I'm really sick re
May 1, 1:56 PM - Yashmitha: In the evening would you like to? If you can get the car 😁😛
May 1, 1:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Can I hold you?
May 1, 1:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to be out in the rain 😞
May 1, 1:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tomorrow morning is my project review.
May 1, 1:57 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm.. That's why get the car no 😝
May 1, 1:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No scene bub. 😜
May 1, 1:58 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂

May 1, 1:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In the car.
May 1, 1:59 PM - Yashmitha: What sort of blackmail is this 😝
May 1, 1:59 PM - Yashmitha: You threatener
May 1, 1:59 PM - Yashmitha: 😐
May 1, 1:59 PM - Yashmitha: 😛
May 1, 1:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At least 15 minutes.
May 1, 1:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then other stuff.
May 1, 2:00 PM - Yashmitha: Get lost. I don't want to meet you 😝
May 1, 2:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😢
May 1, 2:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 10 minutes?
May 1, 2:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or 20?
May 1, 2:02 PM - Yashmitha: After college ends 😝
May 1, 2:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why why?
May 1, 2:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you ending something else when college ends? 😝
May 1, 2:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to buy some books. Blossoms?
May 1, 2:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, I want some exercise equipment. Cross fit training suspensions. I wish I'd made more money this year :(
May 1, 2:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: https://instagram.com/p/2ICTCpluUd/
May 1, 2:05 PM - Yashmitha: I wish you'd made more money too!

May 1, 2:11 PM - Yashmitha: Shoo 😛
May 1, 2:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like being so close you can feel the breath tickle your face.
May 1, 2:15 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe.. Wrong timing.. Right now I feel horrible that I let the little things matter
May 1, 2:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meaning what re?
May 1, 2:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Want me to stop talking?
May 1, 2:16 PM - Yashmitha: About these things, yes 😝
May 1, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm.
May 1, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, but these aren't little things and they don't not matter :*
May 1, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meanwhile, North India is too scary no? Everyone wanted to do a trip, but all plans off.
May 1, 2:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some said Leh, some said Nepal, now everyone's saying Lalbagh.
May 1, 2:17 PM - Yashmitha: Everyone wanted to go but I don't think they are. Lol. Wusses 😛
May 1, 2:17 PM - Yashmitha: Hahahahahaha 😂
May 1, 2:17 PM - Yashmitha: Who wanted Leh?
May 1, 2:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some people in my class/college
May 1, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Those people also wanted to go somewhere. Aanchal and all. but I doubt it'll happen.
May 1, 2:18 PM - Yashmitha: Oh.. You guys aren't even going on a trip after college ends?
May 1, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We wanted to before exams, but external reviews might happen before apparently.
May 1, 2:19 PM - Yashmitha: Oh
May 1, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And after, some people are going somewhere with families.
May 1, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not everyone will be there.
May 1, 2:19 PM - Yashmitha: That sucks. When does college end?
May 1, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 15th if review happens early.
May 1, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Around 18th otherwise.
May 1, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Monday might be farewell.
May 1, 2:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't care though. Don't even want to go
May 1, 2:20 PM - Yashmitha: When are exams?
May 1, 2:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The girls all had a sleepover last night apparently. One last sleepover it seems.
May 1, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Exams - 11, 13, 15
May 1, 2:21 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Last sleepover
May 1, 2:21 PM - Yashmitha: Oh shit! May only college ends off??

May 8, 12:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to damn them all to hell.
May 8, 12:46 AM - Yashmitha: Lol. Your abuses are so British, you fancy person 😘

May 23, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought it was 200 each re
May 23, 11:34 PM - Yashmitha: You took 100 for the food later.. Yes
May 23, 11:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I paid 400 + fuel but you paid 200 for me. So 200 + fuel
May 23, 11:37 PM - Yashmitha: Soon 😅
May 23, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're very pretty in that picture

May 24, 12:13 AM - Yashmitha: These people went wedding crashing!
May 24, 12:13 AM - Yashmitha: Palace grounds
May 24, 12:13 AM - Yashmitha: Happened to be a Coorgi wedding 😝
May 24, 12:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Who people?
May 24, 12:14 AM - Yashmitha: Classmates
May 24, 12:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh

May 24, 12:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What re?
May 24, 12:16 AM - Yashmitha: Apu got an RA in Purdue. They're paying her 2k a month!!
May 24, 12:16 AM - Yashmitha: Luxury 😐
May 24, 12:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh damn!

May 24, 12:17 AM - Yashmitha: You know, I think I should prioritize.
May 24, 12:18 AM - Yashmitha: Possibly make a list of colleges & then accordingly choose my field of internship
May 24, 12:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do the college thing after you get the internship
May 24, 12:19 AM - Yashmitha: Hmm.. I'm not keen on the water treatment one re 😐 Catalysis is interesting at least.. I don't know
May 24, 12:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know how relevant the field of internship is but
May 24, 12:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Meaning whether you can do one in one field and then apply to one other field?
May 24, 10:28 AM - Yashmitha: That's what re.. I'm really thinking twice now
May 24, 10:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Why? I don't think it matters. Ask those people what they applied for.
May 24, 10:37 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Because at the MS stage, they just look for proficiency. Not research topics in particular. That's how I see it.
May 24, 10:39 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah bub.. I'll ask. I need to get Purdue or the likes
May 24, 10:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You can get California easily I think.
May 24, 10:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Depends on the work.
May 24, 10:43 AM - Yashmitha: Which California?
May 24, 10:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. Davis or something?
May 24, 10:44 AM - Yashmitha: Davis is difficult bub
May 24, 10:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe Stanford also? I don't know much about chemical, but when you to down this route all these options open out to you.
May 24, 10:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It negates your GPA, college and everything. You're on par with the best. Close at least.
May 24, 10:45 AM - Yashmitha: Oh man.. Okay I need your help
May 24, 10:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm
May 24, 10:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I need to start earning some money. My Internet connection is shit. Can't get any work done!
May 24, 11:03 AM - Yashmitha: Change it to ACT re
May 24, 11:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Parents irritate.
May 24, 11:28 AM - Yashmitha: Tell them! I think you have communication issues bub
May 24, 11:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I really don't re. My parents are some of the most obstinate, naïve unreasonable people I know.
May 24, 11:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: They do not take my word for anything. I know what I'm doing. I shouldn't have to try to hard to get what I want.
May 24, 11:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't even ask for much. I don't even ask them for money anymore.
May 24, 11:30 AM - Yashmitha: I'd trust my son with my bank account if he was like you 😂
May 24, 11:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😏
May 24, 11:35 AM - Yashmitha: Hehe. You're waste. You'd never break trust
May 24, 11:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😒
May 24, 11:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What's that even supposed to mean?
May 24, 11:36 AM - Yashmitha: Lol. I don't know. You're just trustworthy ❤
May 24, 11:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Fine, I won't be.

May 24, 11:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm.
May 24, 11:38 AM - Yashmitha: What you upto?
May 24, 11:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You know I can't bear to have long hair anymore?
May 24, 11:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I went and cut it yesterday.
May 24, 11:38 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And I keep needing to shave also.
May 24, 11:39 AM - Yashmitha: Really? You're that sick of it?
May 24, 11:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It looks untidy to me.
May 24, 11:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to look shabby.
May 24, 11:42 AM - Yashmitha: Oh.. Stubble is nice bub.. Every 3 days you shave

May 25, 10:42 PM - Yashmitha: You won't do anything?😋
May 25, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know how comfortable she is with anything.
May 25, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe not comfortable at all.
May 25, 10:42 PM - Yashmitha: She's never dated?
May 25, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Something brief in school I think.
May 25, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing while in college.
May 25, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: 😳
May 25, 10:43 PM - Yashmitha: That's a long Break
May 25, 10:44 PM - Yashmitha: I think she'll be okayish. You can text and get to know 😋
May 25, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😒
May 25, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Too much you are.
May 25, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is that how you operate?
May 25, 10:46 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. I am too much no? 😂
May 25, 10:46 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know how I operate.

May 25, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Not with drunk people at least 😂
May 25, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When you're doing anything with drunk people it's horrible because when you were drunk nothing happened.
May 25, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Meaning no one remembers?
May 25, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, meaning when you were drunk with me nothing happened.
May 25, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And people do remember, even when they're drunk. They will eventually. That they don't bring it up is another story.
May 25, 10:51 PM - Yashmitha: Ohh
May 25, 10:51 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Holding hands doesn't count bub. I hold everyone's hand 😜

May 25, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When you tried what?
May 25, 10:53 PM - Yashmitha: Holding your hand and flirting 😝
May 25, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When you did that?
May 25, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: You thought we were back together. That's too much pressure 😝
May 25, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm. Okay missy..
May 25, 10:55 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. You're too confused. Don't you really like Manika?
May 25, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I like her a fair amount
May 25, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But to be honest, I that doesn't mean I don't like you anymore. It doesn't work like that no?
May 25, 10:57 PM - Yashmitha: It should. Otherwise what is the point of leading her on
May 25, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not re.. I like you but I choose to be with her
May 25, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a choice no? Lots of people like lots of other people. You don't shut everything out, you make a choice. That choice maybe suppresses all the other feelings, or it doesn't.
May 25, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it's good with her. I've thrown caution out of the window. We spend too much time together. And it's fun.
May 25, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's been too long since I did this. 2013.
May 25, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: Exactly! I've told you always. If this isn't working out, big deal!
May 25, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: Always nice to have someone you like around as much as possible
May 25, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes it is 😊
May 25, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't even mind being physical with her. She's sort of cute.
May 25, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: See?
May 25, 11:06 PM - Yashmitha: Except, it's unfair for her if you're not that into her & you're still thinking about me.. She won't know but if she does, she won't like it 😛
May 25, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not thinking about you when I'm with her Bummy.
May 25, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm just saying that since we're not going steady or anything, we're not committed or anything, it doesn't matter.
May 25, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When and if I have to choose, I will.
May 25, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One weird girl Ayesha stopped being friends with manika because of me.
May 25, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I got so pissed at that girl.
May 25, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Lol what?? Ayesha likes you? 😂
May 25, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, ew!
May 25, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's gross.
May 25, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: Lol then what happened?
May 25, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a long story, but manika chose me over her once, and she feels hard done by it.
May 25, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's stupid, because who would choose Ayesha?
May 25, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: 😂 You are too much re!!
May 25, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now she's openly criticizing manika, tagging her in bad quotes about changing and moving on on Instagram, stuff like that
May 25, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: Wtf? Ask Manika to block her.
May 25, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: Ridiculous girls.
May 25, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Exactly!
May 25, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When I saw the quote today, I wanted to punch her in the face!
May 25, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's hard to type out but when I tell you you'll see how messed up it is.
May 25, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: I can imagine re. Girls are so ridiculous 😳
May 25, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They need someone to slap them.
May 25, 11:16 PM - Yashmitha: I've heard way too often 😝
May 25, 11:16 PM - Yashmitha: Girls are ridiculous
May 25, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You also ridiculous!
May 25, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Too much you are sometimes.
May 25, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll be flying. You'll be making me the bad guy, of all the pimple.
May 25, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *people
May 25, 11:18 PM - Yashmitha: I'll be flying? 😂
May 25, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. You'll think you're untouchable!
May 25, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Too cool.
May 25, 11:21 PM - Yashmitha: What? 😂😂
May 25, 11:21 PM - Yashmitha: Untouchable, literally??
May 25, 11:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, as though you could do no wrong.
May 25, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: Bwahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂
May 25, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: I'm top much 😂😂😂😂
May 25, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You of all people. 😣
May 25, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: See what the world comes to sometimes.
May 25, 11:22 PM - Yashmitha: I'm too awesome okay? 😝
May 25, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Strange place.
May 25, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently people like you are right all the time 😑
May 25, 11:24 PM - Yashmitha: Yes. I'm always right. Told you the rule no? 😛
May 25, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Shoo.
May 25, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only some stupid people listen to your rules and all.
May 25, 11:26 PM - Yashmitha: You also ❤😘
May 25, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You were friends with manika in school?
May 25, 11:28 PM - Yashmitha: Not really re. She was never in my class. I've always found her pretty & sweet though
May 25, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh.
May 25, 11:32 PM - Yashmitha: She remembers me from school?
May 25, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Everyone remembers you coz you're associated with me :P
May 25, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: Lol! 😂 That means she doesn't remember me from school 😋
May 25, 11:33 PM - Yashmitha: How could I have been her friend then? Fool
May 25, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That means, you and I overshadow everything else they know about you.
May 25, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fool
May 25, 11:34 PM - Yashmitha: You're one dumbass.
May 25, 11:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You only dumbass.

May 25, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I have a feeling you have a thing for mosquitos.
May 25, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Won't even kill them. Now you want to be them.
May 25, 11:40 PM - Yashmitha: 😏

May 26, 11:01 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
May 26, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How that happened?
May 26, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Someone pinched you?
May 26, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Project presentation is easy. Just know what you've to say properly and speak it clearly. Confidence shows that you know the topic. That's all they need to see.
May 26, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: No re. I shut the cab door on my hand. Please tell me it looks painful
May 26, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It does 😞
May 26, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought someone pinched you really hard

May 26, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That you are
May 26, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: No one bothers being violent 😂
May 26, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I pinched you, you beat me up.

May 26, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: When??
May 26, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: I'm a darling. Not delicate though.

May 26, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: Oh yeah. It hurt like a bitch!
May 26, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😑
May 26, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You should learn to be strong monkey.

May 26, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: I'm extremely strong at heart. I don't need to tolerate physical abuse 😒
May 26, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll scream even if your hand is right at the bottom. You're like that. 😑
May 26, 11:13 PM - Yashmitha: You shut up.
May 26, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oho. Strong heart and all she has.
May 26, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Heavy.

May 26, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Another facepalm moment is how your arm fat got stuck in the door 😂
May 27, 3:58 AM - Yashmitha: You're so mean
May 27, 3:58 AM - Yashmitha: My elbow got hit. Ass.
May 27, 6:40 PM - Yashmitha: 😡

May 27, 7:19 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
May 27, 7:19 PM - Yashmitha: Too much. Really.
May 27, 7:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not even that fair.
May 27, 7:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can't see under the shirt.
May 27, 7:21 PM - Yashmitha: You're white. Shut up?
May 27, 7:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😑

May 27, 7:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Poke.
May 27, 7:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Poke
May 27, 7:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Poke.
May 27, 7:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Poke.
May 27, 7:37 PM - Yashmitha: Sorry. I'm dealing with Deepti's breakup.
May 27, 7:37 PM - Yashmitha: Soooo sad!!
May 27, 7:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Awww
May 27, 7:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Shit :/
May 27, 7:42 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
May 27, 7:42 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
May 27, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh damn.
May 27, 7:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's no one's fault.
May 27, 7:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She can't blame herself.
May 27, 7:44 PM - Yashmitha: She cried on Ajay's birthday. I knew something was really off. That girl is so happy all the time, it's not nice to see her cry!
May 27, 7:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh..
May 27, 7:48 PM - Yashmitha: So sad. Shit.
May 27, 7:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Horrible re.. But it just happens.
May 27, 7:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to think about it because it'll just make me sad.
May 27, 7:49 PM - Yashmitha: I know.. I really like her guy. He was two years older, hence very mature!
May 27, 7:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
May 27, 7:50 PM - Yashmitha: So nice to have that
May 27, 7:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I would've said I'm also mature but now is not the time. 😔
May 27, 7:52 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. You aren't, really. That too you're telling me 😝
May 27, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not?
May 27, 7:53 PM - Yashmitha: Not really. Little things irk you!
May 27, 7:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's a difference between being mature and knowing what you like and dislike. There's also a difference between being mature and being happy go lucky.
May 27, 7:56 PM - Yashmitha: You aren't mature about things like your girl hanging out with guys too 😋
May 27, 7:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, that's not true.
May 27, 7:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know when that was, but it's not like that anymore. The girl taking too many liberties won't be appreciated by any guy. Just like the guy taking too many liberties with other girls won't be appreciated.
May 27, 7:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Quid pro quo.
May 27, 7:57 PM - Yashmitha: Ah
May 27, 7:58 PM - Yashmitha: Then okay. You're mature 😝
May 27, 7:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nonsense.
May 27, 7:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You jus like telling me I'm wrong.
May 27, 7:59 PM - Yashmitha: Sometimes you are 😋
May 27, 8:15 PM - Yashmitha: Bub bub!
May 27, 8:16 PM - Yashmitha: How would you pick up a Jewish chick?
May 27, 8:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know too many Hebrew words re :P
May 27, 8:37 PM - Yashmitha: Aye. It's a joke
May 27, 8:37 PM - Yashmitha: You already killed it. Bye.
May 27, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😝
May 27, 8:52 PM - Yashmitha: Waaaaste
May 27, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell no 3
May 27, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ?
May 27, 8:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How you'll do?
May 27, 8:53 PM - Yashmitha: With a broom & dustpan 😏
May 27, 8:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Eh?

May 30, 5:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay so what now?
May 30, 5:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Listen you loser, I have to be in church. If you're not going to tell me quickly I might as well go there.
May 30, 5:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay I'm going to church.. You said five. If I'm at home now they'll send me again tomorrow morning. Bye. :/
May 30, 5:28 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo

May 30, 5:31 PM - Yashmitha: 😭 are you kidding me
May 30, 5:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know how badly I wanted to meet you. I kept asking. But I couldn't stay there much longer. I didn't want to wake up and go to church tomorrow in the morning. Grandma kept asking if I'm not going.
May 30, 5:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, if I'd waited she'd ask me to drop her. So it'd mean nothing. I'd have to come to church anyway. That's why i said 5*
May 30, 5:38 PM - Yashmitha: I'm sure you can get out of there
May 30, 5:38 PM - Yashmitha: I can't meet you before 8th now 😕
May 30, 5:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't walk out on these people after I show up okay?
May 30, 5:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's only 6 of us to sing.
May 30, 5:40 PM - Yashmitha: Okay then leave..
May 30, 5:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not fair.. I waited twenty minutes
May 30, 5:40 PM - Yashmitha: I'll see you after exams 😕
May 30, 5:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sad about this.. But I'm not angry at you. Unavoidable circumstances.
May 30, 5:46 PM - Yashmitha: I'll meet you for a bit after church if possible. I'll let you know.. 😕
May 30, 7:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're going out with them for sure?
May 30, 7:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And you're meeting me for sure?
May 30, 7:22 PM - Yashmitha: My issue is that unless my sister goes with me, they don't let me go.
May 30, 7:22 PM - Yashmitha: My dad thinks I'm always meeting my boyfriend 😛
May 30, 7:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh. If one he knew.
May 30, 7:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *Boyfriends.

May 30, 7:24 PM - Yashmitha: I'm going out for sure. I'll call you when I'm going.
May 30, 7:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How much later are you going out? And where?
May 30, 7:25 PM - Yashmitha: I'll try coming to Kasturi Nagar only
May 30, 7:26 PM - Yashmitha: I'm leaving at 7.45-8
May 30, 7:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm.

May 30, 7:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes?
May 30, 7:27 PM - Yashmitha: My dad's one big issue 😂
May 30, 7:27 PM - Yashmitha: I wouldn't have to think so much otherwise 😛
May 30, 7:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahhh
May 30, 7:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Family issues with manika.
May 30, 7:31 PM - Yashmitha: What?

May 30, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. M

May 30, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😞
May 30, 7:54 PM - Yashmitha: Shit.. My parents aren't that bad 😛
May 30, 7:54 PM - Yashmitha: She can't lie?
May 30, 7:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's living with her aunt.
May 30, 7:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If it was hostel that'd be a possibility.
May 30, 7:56 PM - Yashmitha: Shit! Now she's asking for permission??
May 30, 7:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She asked three days ago. Mom said okay.
May 30, 8:00 PM - Yashmitha: Shit re
May 30, 8:00 PM - Yashmitha: You're going or no?
May 30, 8:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to
May 30, 8:01 PM - Yashmitha: Don't then
May 30, 8:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm. Would you be allowed if you're the only girl?
May 30, 8:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No right?
May 30, 8:02 PM - Yashmitha: Aanchal isn't coming?.
May 30, 8:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aanchal can. But we don't know her position on this. She's on a flight back from Bangkok tonight.
May 30, 8:03 PM - Yashmitha: So then how is Manika the only girl?
May 30, 8:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's not, I'm just asking if you'd go when you're the only girl.
May 30, 8:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because now that's Aanchal's position.
May 30, 8:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One girl, three guys.
May 30, 8:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Or two. Depending.
May 30, 8:05 PM - Yashmitha: I wouldn't go.. But Aanchal is coming. Any chances Manika can?
May 30, 8:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No apparently. Once her dad decides it's done.
May 30, 8:06 PM - Yashmitha: Why did she sat she's the only girl going?
May 30, 8:06 PM - Yashmitha: *say
May 30, 8:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She didn't. She doesn't know yet Bummy. She's on her way back I told you ko?

May 30, 8:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No man! Didn't I tell you I'm not going?
May 30, 8:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I said I don't want to..
May 30, 8:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Are you going to pick me up sometime soon?
May 30, 8:16 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo.. So you cancelled for sure?
May 30, 8:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When are you coming man? I left home already.. :/

May 30, 8:18 PM - Yashmitha: Coming now. Gimme exactly five
May 30, 8:21 PM - Yashmitha: Where are you waiting?
May 30, 8:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Near med plus
May 30, 9:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You detest any physical contact with me no? Horrible person.
May 30, 9:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Take that wave you gave me and shove it up.
May 30, 9:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "I hate bikes" she says. Stupid bitch.
May 30, 9:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me you hate me.
May 30, 9:55 PM - Yashmitha: What on earth?
May 30, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Damn annoying. I don't get a hug.
May 30, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't get anything.
May 30, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Everyone else gets treated better than me.
May 30, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Always.
May 30, 9:58 PM - Yashmitha: Haven't I always told you I can only like bike rides with Kunal?
May 30, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah Yeah, you've told me everything.
May 30, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Screw you.
May 30, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't appreciate me for anything.
May 30, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Made me feel ridiculous, ignoring me today.
May 30, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If someone else talks a lot it's cool. If I talk, I should shut up.
May 30, 10:08 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
May 30, 10:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sure you hugged him when he dropped you off.
May 30, 10:09 PM - Yashmitha: And you wonder why I never take you to meet my friends?
May 30, 10:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm tired of the rules being different for me. I like being around you. I like being myself around you.
May 30, 10:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But you don't care.
May 30, 10:09 PM - Yashmitha: I didn't 😑
May 30, 10:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Means nothing as long as there are others that you can run after.
May 30, 10:11 PM - Yashmitha: You are yourself. Am I stopping you?
May 30, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes you are. All the time.
May 30, 10:13 PM - Yashmitha: 😕 I like having you around too. But don't you think it's too much if you're so physically close when my sister is around.. Lol. How awkward?
May 30, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't enjoy what I say. Never. But if someone else says something you'll be over the moon. So happy, so cheerful..
May 30, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She knows you cry to me. She knows you come to me for everything, however personal. But a little physical contact is so inappropriate.
May 30, 10:16 PM - Yashmitha: I told you. No one else is serious about it. If you say something, you mean it. It's obviously different!
May 30, 10:16 PM - Yashmitha: Ew. It's weird re. Really weird. 😕
May 30, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
May 30, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: You can't argue with that 😂 I'd never touch you when your sibling was around 😂
May 30, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: Plus, what is with you? Aren't you having a scene with Manika??
May 30, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: You're breaking her trust?
May 30, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing is with me. Loser. My problem is that you treat me differently than everyone else.
May 30, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And different in a bad way.
May 30, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: I don't. You just feel that way.
May 30, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I do feel that way.. I feel like a stranger when I'm out with you.
May 30, 10:36 PM - Yashmitha: Go re. Mean thing!
May 30, 10:36 PM - Yashmitha: You'll never see how I actually put in effort for you
May 30, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're only mean.. You make me feel out of place :( 
I feel the same about you! I feel like you don't see how I put in so much effort for you!
May 30, 10:41 PM - Yashmitha: You should divert your attention away from this really..
May 30, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't ignore it. It makes me feel bad that I think of you so much but I don't get appreciated..
May 30, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: Sigh. I don't know what to say
May 30, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm.. Leave it.. It was on my mind so I said it.
May 30, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was actually fine till you dropped me off and then just ran away. Made me wonder who I was to you..
May 30, 10:52 PM - Yashmitha: Sorry.. Hugs when I see you & say bye next time onwards
May 30, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay.. I wish I didn't have to ask like this everytime :(
May 30, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: You won't have to..
May 30, 11:01 PM - Yashmitha: Just don't push me for anything physically.. I'm beyond a point where that can work 😄
May 30, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
May 30, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: But I do love you. Always
May 30, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I do too. If I didn't I don't think I'd want to see you ever :P
May 30, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not a bad person. Shut up
May 30, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're a difficult person..
May 30, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: As much as you insist I am, I'm very simple
May 30, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're the difficult one
May 30, 11:11 PM - Yashmitha: I should make myself worth it
May 30, 11:41 PM - Yashmitha: I'll mostly be leaving really early tomorrow bub
May 30, 11:41 PM - Yashmitha: So good night & I'll text when I'm back.. Love you! Have fun with Manika. 😏
May 30, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night

Jun 1, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I saw your card from 2009, 2010
Jun 1, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Birthday stuff.
Jun 1, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then some messages and all.
Jun 1, 10:11 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe.. Simply you'll do all that?
Jun 1, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was cleaning stuff out. Found the card.
Jun 1, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was wondering what happened to us. It's sad.
Jun 1, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I met the tiny one today.
Jun 1, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's gotten so fat.
Jun 1, 10:12 PM - Yashmitha: Eh. I know what happened 😛
Jun 1, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No you don't know what happened. You got disinterested :/
Jun 1, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: She's gotten fat indeed
Jun 1, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: No. That's not what happened 😅
Jun 1, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She also wasn't wearing a bra.
Jun 1, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It happened re.. :/
Jun 1, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: What??
Jun 1, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I could see stuff 😑
Jun 1, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know me no?
Jun 1, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're back home? How come you went for such a short duration?
Jun 1, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: I'm leaving now  actually
Jun 1, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: With dad
Jun 1, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: Festival re
Jun 1, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Jun 1, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Coming back tomorrow?
Jun 1, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's over with manika re.. The last two days have been so harrowing.
Jun 1, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: What the hell?
Jun 1, 10:20 PM - Yashmitha: What ever happened?
Jun 1, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Parents happened.
Jun 1, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: Explain..
Jun 1, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She couldn't come to Goa because her parents said no. I made everyone cancel because I didn't want to go without her.
Jun 1, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then she said she's here only till Wednesday.
Jun 1, 10:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She said she's got to go home early everyday.
Jun 1, 10:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Today her parents came so she had to go back soon. 
Tomorrow she can't come out coz they're there.
Jun 1, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Probably the same on Wednesday either. May not meet her again. 
I don't believe that she'll come back here once she's in chikmaglur.
Jun 1, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then it's off to Seattle.
Jun 1, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: Oh crap
Jun 1, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Jun 1, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Her parents run her life
Jun 1, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She won't even put up a fight!
Jun 1, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: That's sad re
Jun 1, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah whatever..
Jun 1, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm..
Jun 1, 10:26 PM - Yashmitha: I'll call you and talk to you once I reach coz dad's here
Jun 1, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, that's okay.
Jun 1, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't need to be spoken to.
Jun 1, 10:47 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Jun 1, 10:48 PM - Yashmitha: To cheer you up. My little red riding hood
Jun 1, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This is all I'm going to get.
Jun 1, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Every person I meet will be like this.
Jun 1, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want to do this anymore..
Jun 1, 10:52 PM - Yashmitha: And you wonder why I stopped? It's just disappointment 😅
Jun 1, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Please. It was disappointing for you?
Jun 1, 10:53 PM - Yashmitha: I went through shit when you weren't as mature. Please :P
Jun 1, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm..
Jun 1, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I realized exactly how long you've known me.
Jun 1, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Four years of college are over.
Jun 1, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Two years of school too.
Jun 1, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's crazy!
Jun 1, 11:04 PM - Yashmitha: I know right
Jun 1, 11:04 PM - Yashmitha: Feels like forever in a good way though
Jun 1, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Jun 1, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the funny thing re. I told you no? Sometimes I feel like others are so much more important.
Jun 2, 5:44 AM - Yashmitha: Who others?
Jun 2, 9:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know re. Random people. Classmates, friends.
Jun 2, 9:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you no? I feel like I'm competing with them sometimes. And I'm losing.
Jun 2, 9:16 AM - Yashmitha: You're not sweetu 😘

Jun 2, 9:53 AM - Yashmitha: Not really. I told her once that you'd gone somewhere with Manika. Why.
Jun 2, 9:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Just asking. She was with me when I met her yesterday.
Jun 2, 9:53 AM - Yashmitha: Oh! Ushoo heavy
Jun 2, 9:54 AM - Yashmitha: Where did you'll go?
Jun 2, 9:54 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yesterday everyone went to drink so I didn't take my bike
Jun 2, 9:54 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Big Pitcher. But it was shit so we left immediately.
Jun 2, 9:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I had her umbrella so I thought I'd return it.
Jun 2, 9:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's all.
Jun 2, 9:55 AM - Yashmitha: Oh like that. Didn't hang out?
Jun 2, 9:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Not with the tiny one re :P
Jun 2, 9:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Dropped it off, spoke for a bit and left.
Jun 2, 9:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It was going to rain also, at least it looked like it would.
Jun 2, 9:56 AM - Yashmitha: Oh :P She didn't ask questions?
Jun 2, 9:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No re.. She usually doesn't no?
Jun 2, 9:57 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Jun 2, 9:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe when she knows both people well, or when I'm alone. Like she asks about us.
Jun 2, 9:58 AM - Yashmitha: Ah.. Okay
Jun 2, 9:58 AM - Yashmitha: Bub What's Spotify?
Jun 2, 9:58 AM - Yashmitha: Why is it a big deal?
Jun 2, 9:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Who's making it a big deal?
Jun 2, 9:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's an online music streaming application.
Jun 2, 9:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Something like gaana and all.
Jun 2, 9:59 AM - Yashmitha: Oh.. Okay
Jun 2, 9:59 AM - Yashmitha: I don't know Gaana either 😛
Jun 2, 9:59 AM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Jun 2, 10 AM - Yashmitha: This cutie!
Jun 2, 10:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Who's making it a big deal?
Jun 2, 10:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: So plump!
Jun 2, 10:00 AM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Jun 2, 10:00 AM - Yashmitha: She looks like Etasha no?
Jun 2, 10:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Little bit :)
Jun 2, 10:01 AM - Yashmitha: Too cute! ☺ I just carried her for two days 😝
Jun 2, 10:01 AM - Yashmitha: And no, people in college spoke about it so I just asked
Jun 2, 10:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Aiyyo! You're one more monkey.
Jun 2, 10:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Its a swedish service that doesn't work in india yet
Jun 2, 10:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Gaana is good, use it and see. It has pretty much every song out there from what I've searched. English and Hindi. Maybe even regional.
Jun 2, 10:07 AM - Yashmitha: Apparently they found how to make it work here so it's a big deal.. Idk
Jun 2, 10:07 AM - Yashmitha: Okay re. Lol
Jun 2, 10:10 AM - Yashmitha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qym11JnFQBM
Jun 2, 10:10 AM - Yashmitha: How long ago did you know about this? 😝
Jun 2, 10:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't make me feel bad I talk to you man :P
Jun 2, 10:14 AM - Yashmitha: Tell 😕
Jun 2, 10:15 AM - Yashmitha: 😝
Jun 2, 10:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The day it came out
Jun 2, 10:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mid jan.
Jun 2, 10:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There was an ant in my pants :-/
Jun 2, 10:20 AM - Yashmitha: Oh crap
Jun 2, 10:20 AM - Yashmitha: Did it bite your bum? 😂😂😂
Jun 2, 10:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It bit my thigh 😞
Jun 2, 10:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do something about it?
Jun 2, 10:57 AM - Yashmitha: Damn. This is where I feel bad about you & Manika not workout out 😛
Jun 2, 10:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😑
Jun 2, 11:10 AM - Yashmitha: 😝
Jun 2, 11:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummy. Why you're like this.
Jun 2, 8:03 PM - Yashmitha: Bub
Jun 2, 8:03 PM - Yashmitha: Adarsh got frikkin Michigan 😕
Jun 2, 8:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hi Bob.
Jun 2, 8:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who's this Adarsh?
Jun 2, 8:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Names I haven't heard of only!
Jun 2, 8:04 PM - Yashmitha: The senior who got CMU
Jun 2, 8:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh.
Jun 2, 8:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's in the same vein re
Jun 2, 8:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why do you think I applied where I applied?
Jun 2, 8:05 PM - Yashmitha: Mmm. The one who interned in IISc
Jun 2, 8:05 PM - Yashmitha: Yeayy
Jun 2, 8:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll also get next year
Jun 2, 8:06 PM - Yashmitha: 😘
Jun 2, 8:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They worked one year no? But applied after 6 months?
Jun 2, 8:06 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Jun 2, 8:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh.
Jun 2, 8:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But they applied for MS?
Jun 2, 8:08 PM - Yashmitha: I'll ask
Jun 2, 8:08 PM - Yashmitha: PhD is easier?
Jun 2, 8:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, PhD is way harder and they need plenty more research capability estimates.
Jun 2, 8:09 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Then why you asking like that.😛
Jun 2, 8:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Lots more papers, clear area of focus in your SOP.
Jun 2, 8:10 PM - Yashmitha: I told you Swami Sir was impressed with us & asked us to work on it a little more & publish a paper?
Jun 2, 8:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Very strong recommendation for research work from a noted professor.
Jun 2, 8:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, you only told me you went out after the project to celebrate. With people you don't even like. 😒
Jun 2, 8:14 PM - Yashmitha: This happened on another day when he called us to college re
Jun 2, 8:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh.
Jun 2, 8:15 PM - Yashmitha: 😛
Jun 2, 8:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's good.
Jun 2, 8:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I shall shower and come back.
Jun 2, 8:17 PM - Yashmitha: Okay re
Jun 2, 8:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Jun 2, 8:31 PM - Yashmitha: Awww?
Jun 2, 8:31 PM - Yashmitha: Today?
Jun 2, 8:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Last day today.
Jun 2, 8:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Watsons.
Jun 2, 8:32 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Jun 2, 8:32 PM - Yashmitha: She's gone back?
Jun 2, 8:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She leaves tomorrow morning.
Jun 2, 8:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm trying to get her to admit that the way they are at home is shitty and that she needs to do something about it. That she's in a position to do something about it.
Jun 2, 8:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nonsensical parents. The rest of the family does everything. Only those two are like that.
Jun 2, 8:34 PM - Yashmitha: What does she think?
Jun 2, 8:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's too naïve. She thinks she just has to accept it because it's right or they're right or whatever.
Jun 2, 8:36 PM - Yashmitha: You can never change that re
Jun 2, 8:36 PM - Yashmitha: Don't end up fighting
Jun 2, 8:36 PM - Yashmitha: Did she say she was going to miss you?
Jun 2, 8:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Which part can you not change?
Jun 2, 8:40 PM - Yashmitha: Her naivety
Jun 2, 8:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's just because of how they've brought her up. It's sad.
Jun 2, 8:44 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah?
Jun 2, 8:44 PM - Yashmitha: They scold & all?
Jun 2, 8:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They scold, dismiss, just generally treat her badly. She cant make a decision on her own because she's never been allowed to.
Jun 2, 9:00 PM - Yashmitha: She's the only child?
Jun 2, 9:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes
Jun 2, 9:01 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Jun 2, 9:01 PM - Yashmitha: But it's worked out well for her..Who's complaining about BMS, UW?
Jun 2, 9:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've asked her a lot about them okay? Some really sickening details she's told them..
Jun 2, 9:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *told me.
Jun 2, 9:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Please re, honestly she's as shocked as anyone else about getting in anywhere.
Jun 2, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: On paper it's impressive, but nothing can really tell you how or why it happened.
Jun 2, 9:03 PM - Yashmitha: Ah..
Jun 2, 9:04 PM - Yashmitha: Shit.. Why do you know only the troubled?
Jun 2, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm trying to help her. Let's see where it goes.
Jun 2, 9:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know they send her to Art of Living?
Jun 2, 9:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Wth?
Jun 2, 9:06 PM - Yashmitha: :/
Jun 2, 9:06 PM - Yashmitha: She doesn't like it?
Jun 2, 9:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She doesn't like what?
Jun 2, 9:07 PM - Yashmitha: Art of living
Jun 2, 9:07 PM - Yashmitha: I like that stuff
Jun 2, 9:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's bullshit :/
Jun 2, 9:08 PM - Yashmitha: You don't know that re
Jun 2, 9:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a way for people to just burn money.
Jun 2, 9:08 PM - Yashmitha: Your face. You don't know, don't talk 😅
Jun 2, 9:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll teach you art of living.
Jun 2, 9:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Your religion is your business, but anything that costs you money on that scale has something fishy going on. Do they charge just enough for the sustainance of the ashram? No. They get way more money than you can imagine. Donations, this and that. No one's going to audit them. No one's going to come and ask questions.
Jun 2, 9:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a scam.
Jun 2, 9:21 PM - Yashmitha: People are trying to buy happiness. Really.. They'll do anything for peace of mind & AOL doesn't disappoint
Jun 2, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Please don't buy into all that re.
Jun 2, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How you know about it?
Jun 2, 9:30 PM - Yashmitha: I don't that sort of money re :P
Jun 2, 9:30 PM - Yashmitha: Don't have
Jun 2, 9:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't buy into it I said.
Jun 2, 9:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Into the idea.
Jun 2, 9:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I'll tell you - be happy, be silent, breathe hard. I'll feed you simple food and have some guys teach you some yoga that pretty much everyone has access to because it's common knowledge. 

You'll pay me 30k for that?
Jun 2, 9:33 PM - Yashmitha: It's like a holiday coz it's one week there at the ashram.. People like the idea
Jun 2, 9:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mm. Okay.
Jun 2, 9:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll just get mad if we stay on the topic :P
Jun 2, 9:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sucks re, all this stuff.
Jun 2, 9:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hate it. I hate people ripping other people off.
Jun 2, 9:37 PM - Yashmitha: That's harmless as opposed to people trying to convert other people's faith free of charge :P
Jun 2, 9:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Think about this. Propagating ideas, in one case for free. In the other, for money.
Jun 2, 9:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: People are free to accept whatever ideas that make them feel good about it.
Jun 2, 9:38 PM - Yashmitha: Conversion of faith, in the timid, is crime. Making you believe in yourself isn't.
Jun 2, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If it really was the Art of Living, secrets to a better life, a good life, are only the rich worthy of it?
Jun 2, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What sort of bias is that?
Jun 2, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're rich, I'll teach you how to breathe. Oh, that'll be 30k please.
Jun 2, 9:39 PM - Yashmitha: It's the sort of living the rich need to learn!! Austere living is what they propagate!
Jun 2, 9:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like they're selling a lie. I hate those things. The ones where they try to teach people these things.
Jun 2, 9:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't believe in conversation either. That's not fair. But this isn't either
Jun 2, 9:42 PM - Yashmitha: They're teaching people what wrong, exactly?
Jun 2, 9:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: May be nothing wrong.
Jun 2, 9:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But the way they posture themselves, as a non-profit, community servicing, pro society foundation. It's all a sham.
Jun 2, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Religion is what is wrong with the world. If people stopped obsessing, differentiating, fighting over these things the world would be a better place.
Jun 2, 9:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It does more harm than good.
Jun 2, 10:16 PM - Yashmitha: They're not teaching religion. At all. How is it religion if they're not involving anything but austerity & yoga? :/
Jun 2, 10:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re. You mentioned religion, so I said this. It was a side point.
Jun 2, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: Nobody here does that.
Jun 2, 10:19 PM - Yashmitha: Conversion on the other hand is just this. Community service they say. Bullshit.
Jun 2, 10:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nobody here does what?
Jun 2, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The only reason you're feeling like you learnt something is because you're giving away so much money in exchange.
Jun 2, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you feel like you gave it away for nothing, then you'll just feel bad.
Jun 2, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's the same as going to the doctor and taking medicines for some illness.
Jun 2, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You feel like you've been cured. It's placebo. A state of mind.
Jun 2, 10:22 PM - Yashmitha: Maybe. I'm just arguing that this isn't anything to do with religion
Jun 2, 10:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, that may be.
Jun 2, 10:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I'm arguing that people shouldn't be misled by other people like this.
Jun 2, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: You're upset about AOL for charging for something that's actually harmless whereas you're blind eyed about free conversion. :P
Jun 2, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who said P
Jun 2, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ?
Jun 2, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like conversion.
Jun 2, 10:27 PM - Yashmitha: You should be arguing that instead. It's more intense!
Jun 2, 10:27 PM - Yashmitha: And at an unbelievably large scale
Jun 2, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You really don't need to sell the demerits of religion to me re.
Jun 2, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm not even going to argue because my stance is clear.
Jun 2, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Forget conversion. I don't even think religion should exist.
Jun 2, 10:36 PM - Yashmitha: It's got its merits & demerits bub
Jun 2, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sure, the cultural aspects are nice. It leads to diversity. But the rest of it is bullshit. Do you really need religion to tell you What's right and what's wrong P
Jun 2, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ?
Jun 2, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't your intelligence do that for you?
Jun 2, 10:37 PM - Yashmitha: You need to put in your faith somewhere!
Jun 2, 10:38 PM - Yashmitha: Need to know where you're going. It helps to believe that there's a supreme being guiding you.
Jun 2, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because essentially it's about right and wrong. About actions and consequences.
Jun 2, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You do the thing that'll get to where you want to be.
Jun 2, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's it! That's life!
Jun 2, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Does one need a marriage ceremony to ensure that it becomes sacred or sanctimonious? It's not immediately obvious that you can't just keep going back on what you said you'd do?
Jun 2, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just like that, so many other instances and examples.
Jun 2, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But when I think about it, not everyone's cognition is high performing. Most can't grasp these concepts. 

It's so beautifully constructed, to ensure that people follow rules because they're associated with "holy" texts and so on. No?
Jun 2, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I think, for people who can think for themselves, these things shouldn't really matter. Because what they're saying is what you know already. There's no need to follow a roundabout way and get to the same point.
Jun 2, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Jun 2, 10:45 PM - Yashmitha: It's too much for me to understand 😕
Jun 2, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's okay, never mind 😘
Jun 2, 10:47 PM - Yashmitha: It's too much. I'm having to read twice. I like how you talk like this though. If only I could respond appropriately 😛
Jun 2, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :P
Jun 2, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Despite all that, one thing I really do appreciate is the new Pope. You know how the Catholic Church is so staunch and seeped in centuries old scriptures and teachings no? Denying evolution and homosexuality and the right to abortion and divorce and things like that?
Jun 2, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. He's got swag 😋
Jun 2, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The new Pope is absolutely brilliant. He's so liberal, and it's such a refreshing change. He says the things that everyone's thinking. He wants to change and make things relevant to the present generation again.
Jun 2, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: We need more people like that mg
Jun 2, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Especially if they're teaching religion
Jun 2, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Jun 2, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Things like contraception and celibacy and all are very strong topics with respect to the church.
Jun 2, 10:52 PM - Yashmitha: True that. No one bothers being open minded
Jun 2, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's one of the most conservative bodies. But this guy wants to talk about it. He says it's okay, he admits it's required.
Jun 2, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He uses social media. Addresses the problems people face these days.
Jun 2, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's revolutionary.
Jun 2, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Still though. I know what they're preaching. And I know what they hope it can do for you.
Jun 2, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And that's what makes it a futile exercise for me.
Jun 2, 10:55 PM - Yashmitha: I'm in no position to judge really.
Jun 2, 10:55 PM - Yashmitha: I've never tried to argue this in my mind
Jun 2, 10:55 PM - Yashmitha: I'm too scared to go on about life without support
Jun 2, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re. I'll tell you what happens. For most people it's easier to just follow along with those rules.
Jun 2, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because it gets you there.
Jun 2, 10:56 PM - Yashmitha: As long as it does!
Jun 2, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But for me, what I want and what those rules want is the same thing. F
Jun 2, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For me to be happy and for the world to be a better place.
Jun 2, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I ask, if we have the same objective, why is it wrong for me to go about achieving it the way I feel comfortable? Because even the ones that composed these rules were people just like me..
Jun 2, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know, the way I see it might be wrong. But that's what I think.
Jun 2, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: It's not wrong for you to go about without believing re. Hence not wrong to be a believer either! One's choice afterall
Jun 2, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Without believing in a higher power?
Jun 2, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes I do believe. But I like being practical and realistic as far as possible. Rational.
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: In religion
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. Just feel comfortable that way..
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. That's you. But some people really need the support. It's not wrong to believe :)
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: True
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: You've always been practical
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: How's mommy doing btw
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's okay re.
Jun 2, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: When's she back?
Jun 2, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Worried about us.
Jun 2, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 24th
Jun 2, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But there's nothing to worry about.
Jun 2, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My life is too sad :P
Jun 2, 11:06 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Why?? Your grandma is perfect for you'll!
Jun 2, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm back home before it's dark every single day. 🙈
Jun 2, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: How cute 😋
Jun 2, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: Lol
Jun 2, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: You'll miss the girl, bub?
Jun 2, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Manika sent me flowers :P
Jun 2, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Which girl missy?
Jun 2, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: She actually sent?
Jun 2, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Her only re
Jun 2, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Wow
Jun 2, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: But you don't like flowers
Jun 2, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Photo
Jun 2, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: Oh 😂
Jun 2, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I like looking at flowers. They just smell bad :P
Jun 2, 11:09 PM - Yashmitha: Wow. So easy to send flowers to you. Lol
Jun 2, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😝
Jun 2, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll miss her. She was nice. And she really really liked me.
Jun 2, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. When's she off to Seattle? Isn't coming to Bangalore before that for a while?
Jun 2, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like the Carly Rae Jepson song.
Jun 2, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😝
Jun 2, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Seattle will be early August. 10-15th.
Jun 2, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She said she'll try to come in between. But her life's in her parents' hands so I can't really take her word for it.
Jun 2, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe awww :) Summer love 😋 You didn't even kiss her. Waste :P
Jun 2, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Shoo. You waste.
Jun 2, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You didn't even kiss me. 😒
Jun 2, 11:13 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Don't change the topic :P You should have :P
Jun 2, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then what'd happen?
Jun 2, 11:15 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know. You'd remember it :P
Jun 2, 11:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh yeah? :P
Jun 2, 11:16 PM - Yashmitha: Of course!
Jun 2, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Jun 2, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This one is really nice.
Jun 3, 9:02 AM - Yashmitha: It's adorable :)
Jun 3, 9:02 AM - Yashmitha: ❤❤
Jun 3, 9:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: :P
Jun 3, 7:34 PM - Yashmitha: That haircut is so ugly though 😑
Jun 3, 7:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Whose?
Jun 3, 7:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not mine no?
Jun 3, 7:38 PM - Yashmitha: Yours only 😋
Jun 3, 7:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😒

Jun 3, 8:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Loser bum.

Jun 3, 8:13 PM - Yashmitha: Wtf 😂😂
Jun 3, 8:13 PM - Yashmitha: Fool 😂
Jun 3, 8:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like the movie?
Jun 3, 8:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Except you wouldn't come after me to find and rescue me?
Jun 3, 8:37 PM - Yashmitha: Which movie 😳
Jun 3, 8:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "Taken" man.
Jun 3, 8:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Loser face.
Jun 3, 8:55 PM - Yashmitha: Oh. Lol. Wow. I don't even get your references!
Jun 3, 8:55 PM - Yashmitha: <Media omitted>
Jun 3, 8:55 PM - Yashmitha: Ugliest pimple ever 😡
Jun 3, 8:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh, there's a face on your pimple. 😂
Jun 3, 8:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Geek huh? 😏
Jun 3, 8:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd like some geeks.
Jun 3, 8:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They're good fun.
Jun 3, 8:58 PM - Yashmitha: You ass!
Jun 3, 8:58 PM - Yashmitha: What a bitch. You wait till you get one 😝

Jun 3, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: Oh that :P
Jun 3, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. I feel slow. I don't get anything 😑
Jun 3, 9:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Haven't been in touch with me enough.
Jun 3, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: By in touch, I mean IN TOUCH.
Jun 3, 9:51 PM - Yashmitha: Lol! I know. 😝
Jun 3, 9:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How about we change that?
Jun 3, 9:52 PM - Yashmitha: I was really liking how you wouldn't say these things when Manika was there re. 😛
Jun 3, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why is that?
Jun 3, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Seriously, how can you like when I don't say these things? No one is half as interesting. 😒
Jun 3, 9:56 PM - Yashmitha: I'm not sure really :P
Jun 3, 9:57 PM - Yashmitha: Lol! It's not that I don't. I've been a huge fan of it 😂
Jun 3, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're a huge fan huh? But not anymore.
Jun 3, 9:57 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. Not anymore re.. I don't know 😅
Jun 3, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Jun 3, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You really do feel that way no?
Jun 3, 9:58 PM - Yashmitha: I do. I'm not trying to pretend that I'm not 😅
Jun 3, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How're you pretending?
Jun 3, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh, not trying to pretend.
Jun 3, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm
Jun 3, 10:03 PM - Yashmitha: So if you notice how it was when you were busy with her, you'd see that you need a nice person with you & it need not be me
Jun 3, 10:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's true.
Jun 3, 10:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I like you no?
Jun 3, 10:04 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Doesn't matter. You'll always like me for what we are at whatever point.
Jun 3, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sigh
Jun 3, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it's seriously tough re.. To accept that you feel nothing for me, but you might feel something for someone else.
Jun 3, 10:22 PM - Yashmitha: Why is that so? I believe I'm allowed to make those choices 😛
Jun 3, 10:22 PM - Yashmitha: And you don't talk, hypocrite. 😛
Jun 3, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You are.. But I'm allowed to feel bad about it
Jun 3, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At no point have I disliked you. You know that.
Jun 3, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At some point, I've disliked how you treated me.
Jun 3, 10:23 PM - Yashmitha: I haven't either!!
Jun 3, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Whatever I did was a reaction to that treatment :/
Jun 3, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: I don't dislike you. I just am not in love with you. I really like you though. That won't change.
Jun 3, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
Jun 3, 10:24 PM - Yashmitha: Whatever you did?
Jun 3, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: As in whatever you're calling me a hypocrite for
Jun 3, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Manika or Shruti? 😂
Jun 3, 10:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What're you calling me a hypocrite for?
Jun 3, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I keep wanting you and you keep rebuffing me. How do you know that whatever I did was not some sort of knee-jerk reaction or a rebound reaction?
Jun 3, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I feel sad or lonely?
Jun 3, 10:28 PM - Yashmitha: It's okay if it was. It was keeping you happy!
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: Okay I should go
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: Exam tomorrow
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: And this conversation never ends 😕
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't have a point re :/
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: I'll explain it later
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: Good night bubb
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night. All the best.
Jun 3, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: Thank you 😄
Jun 4, 7:01 PM - Yashmitha: Hi re

Jun 4, 7:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh

Jun 4, 7:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No!
Jun 4, 7:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So horrible.
Jun 4, 7:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Didn't reply saying no also.
Jun 4, 7:30 PM - Yashmitha: Call someone up
Jun 4, 7:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It doesn't work like that.
Jun 4, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No one responds if they don't know where you've come from.
Jun 4, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If someone doesn't send you.
Jun 4, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Same as with IISc professors.
Jun 4, 7:31 PM - Yashmitha: But someone did refer you no?
Jun 4, 7:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One guy who's worked there before.
Jun 4, 7:32 PM - Yashmitha: That's not enough?
Jun 4, 7:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I asked him to email and he said he would but then he said he's not in town and that he's going on a trip with his IIT mates and  he'll do it once he gets back.
Jun 4, 7:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Couldn't say anything to that..
Jun 4, 7:33 PM - Yashmitha: 😕
Jun 4, 7:33 PM - Yashmitha: You can't wait that long
Jun 4, 7:33 PM - Yashmitha: Look for more options re
Jun 4, 7:33 PM - Yashmitha: IBM?
Jun 4, 7:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He also hasn't said anything yet. But I met him on Sunday and he said he'll talk to HR.
Jun 4, 7:35 PM - Yashmitha: Okay
Jun 4, 7:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Jun 4, 7:35 PM - Yashmitha: Don't worry. Something will fall in place
Jun 4, 7:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Manika is too much.
Jun 4, 7:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She got CMU also. Silicon Valley campus though.
Jun 4, 7:36 PM - Yashmitha: Wow! :o
Jun 4, 7:36 PM - Yashmitha: She's going?
Jun 4, 7:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a new program and they don't have much in terms of courses.
Jun 4, 7:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I don't know. I personally don't think she should.
Jun 4, 7:36 PM - Yashmitha: Oh okay.. Then What's too much. Lol.
Jun 4, 7:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Too much, she got 4 admits I think.
Jun 4, 7:37 PM - Yashmitha: How come you didn't get alternatives I'm wondering 😕
Jun 4, 7:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was clear on my intent to do something very specific re.
Jun 4, 7:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe that's why.
Jun 4, 7:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They don't have that stuff on the other campus.
Jun 4, 7:38 PM - Yashmitha: Ah.. Okay re
Jun 4, 7:38 PM - Yashmitha: It'll work out. Don't stop wanting it though!
Jun 4, 7:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd take UW Seattle in a heartbeat.
Jun 4, 7:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's amazing.
Jun 4, 7:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Robotics, AI, ML, everything.
Jun 4, 7:42 PM - Yashmitha: You didn't apply though.
Jun 4, 7:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Of course not. I had ones on the same level.
Jun 4, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: CMU, UTA, UMD, UMich.
Jun 4, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I picked two more. Very ambitious.
Jun 4, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I thought the first four were achievable. That's why I went there with those in mind before I even knew my GRE score no?
Jun 4, 7:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I really didn't think they were out of my reach.
Jun 4, 7:45 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah.. Neither did I
Jun 4, 7:45 PM - Yashmitha: Thought you'd get Maryland for sure
Jun 4, 7:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I only realized in Feb, March that it may be too much of an ask.
Jun 4, 7:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I got an S in project though. Should be able to convince the guide to put us in touch with someone nice.
Jun 4, 7:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hopefully that works out if nothing else.
Jun 4, 7:46 PM - Yashmitha: Wow!! That's amazing! What's your final CGPA?
Jun 4, 7:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's 9.03
Jun 4, 7:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Barely made it.
Jun 4, 7:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Was on 9 after sixth. Then got 8.6 last time. Now 9.68
Jun 4, 7:47 PM - Yashmitha: Crazy crazy. 9.68 😅
Jun 4, 7:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't get an S in OR!
Jun 4, 7:48 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. I hope so too.. Talk to him!
Jun 4, 7:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Could've been .80
Jun 4, 7:48 PM - Yashmitha: Oh 😛
Jun 4, 7:48 PM - Yashmitha: Shoo. 😂😂
Jun 4, 7:48 PM - Yashmitha: That's obscene 😛
Jun 4, 7:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Keep quiet. You'll get an S in project, then you'll also talk like this.
Jun 4, 7:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummy.
Jun 4, 7:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wanted a full sweep. Missed by so little. 3 marks in project management. 5 in IP Rights.
Jun 4, 7:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I owned the seminar. I told you no?
Jun 4, 7:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I need help though. I need a research position. I can do really well as the MS stage. I'll actually give a damn about what I'm studying.
Jun 4, 7:54 PM - Yashmitha: Yes. I know you will.
Jun 4, 7:54 PM - Yashmitha: Bub, you thought of branch change after 1st year?
Jun 4, 7:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It had to be mutual..
Jun 4, 7:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wasn't searching coz I was bothered about getting NIT or BITS
Jun 4, 7:55 PM - Yashmitha: Oh okay..
Jun 4, 7:55 PM - Yashmitha: Anyway, yeah. I wish I could help. I'll try what I can 😄
Jun 4, 8:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Thanks re
Jun 4, 8:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *hug*
Jun 4, 8:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How was your exam?
Jun 4, 8:19 PM - Yashmitha: 😘
Jun 4, 8:19 PM - Yashmitha: I messed it up. I was so prepared re. Feeling so bad
Jun 4, 8:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aww? It's okay sweetie! You'll do well in the next two!

Jun 4, 8:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's taken over.
Jun 4, 8:42 PM - Yashmitha: Haha! You miss mommy?
Jun 4, 8:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She makes food for us and all. 😝
Jun 4, 8:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't miss anyone, you know that no?
Jun 4, 8:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: As in, I rarely miss people.
Jun 4, 8:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't talk to them enough to be able to miss them
Jun 4, 8:43 PM - Yashmitha: Obviously she makes food! 😂😂
Jun 4, 8:44 PM - Yashmitha: She's taken over it seems 😂
Jun 4, 8:44 PM - Yashmitha: Oho really?
Jun 4, 8:44 PM - Yashmitha: Don't you miss Manika?
Jun 4, 8:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What really?
Jun 4, 8:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't miss her. I miss being with her in person, but she's able to text and call sometimes so it's okay.
Jun 4, 8:45 PM - Yashmitha: This is too upsetting no?
Jun 4, 8:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Which part 400
Jun 4, 8:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *?
Jun 4, 8:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That she had to go?
Jun 4, 8:46 PM - Yashmitha: That you only did this so late
Jun 4, 8:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay actually. It was worse when she was here. Family would keep asking where she needs to go everyday, why she's spending so much, why she's staying late, etc.
Jun 4, 8:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No actually. Maybe in some ways it's unfortunate. But at least it happened. Good to know that someone else feels so strongly about you
Jun 4, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She was trying to crack jokes today. Facepalm moments.
Jun 4, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like you only!
Jun 4, 8:49 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂
Jun 4, 8:49 PM - Yashmitha: You just don't get the jokes.
Jun 4, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Get out.
Jun 4, 8:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm just used to a different level of humor.
Jun 4, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So this one stupid girl from church was talking about kids okay. About how she doesn't want and all.
Jun 4, 8:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then suddenly she asked me how many I want. I said I just want money.
Jun 4, 8:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So then I was telling manika. She said if I have kids they'll be called dollar, pound and yen. 😑
Jun 4, 8:59 PM - Yashmitha: Bwahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂
Jun 4, 8:59 PM - Yashmitha: That's too funny!! I laughed 😂😂😂😋😂
Jun 4, 9:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're one waste.
Jun 4, 9:00 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Jun 4, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: With That short hair, yes 😂
Jun 4, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 😑
Jun 4, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He's a joker! I don't want to look like him
Jun 4, 10:31 PM - Yashmitha: Lol! I don't find him the least bit attractive! Everyone does

Jun 5, 8:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummy.
Jun 5, 8:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Let's go on a date.

Jun 5, 8:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Grad Admissions.htm - http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Grad%20Admissions.htm
Jun 5, 8:58 AM - Yashmitha: Hehe.. Right now I'm unattractive 😋
Jun 5, 8:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: See. Exactly what I said about the college you come from and the work you've done.
Jun 5, 9:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay, evening then. 😏
Jun 5, 9:01 AM - Yashmitha: Lol! Pimple re. 😂
Jun 5, 9:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Face on your pimple?
Jun 5, 9:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😂
Jun 5, 9:05 AM - Yashmitha: This CMU thing is so well written for abstract dreamers 😋
Jun 5, 9:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Like you
Jun 5, 9:05 AM - Yashmitha: Like you 😑
Jun 5, 9:05 AM - Yashmitha: You don't have the second bit at all 😑
Jun 5, 9:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm just too shocked that you even opened the link
Jun 5, 9:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, I told you. He also suggests easier colleges.
Jun 5, 9:07 AM - Yashmitha: And then he suggests you can get your PhD from there
Jun 5, 9:07 AM - Yashmitha: Hmmmm
Jun 5, 9:07 AM - Yashmitha: Too much effort
Jun 5, 9:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. But if you earn the credit, get good enough recommendations, it's not going to be a problem.
Jun 5, 9:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He says that's what they're looking for anyway.
Jun 5, 9:08 AM - Yashmitha: Then awesome..
Jun 5, 9:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: By credit I mean research credibility.
Jun 5, 9:09 AM - Yashmitha: I don't know why you didn't intern anywhere during college
Jun 5, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I don't know why :(
Jun 5, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But research re. Even those who did didn't get. Sharma had ISRO and another one internship.
Jun 5, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Couldn't get GaTech, Austin or Princeton.
Jun 5, 9:10 AM - Yashmitha: Okay
Jun 5, 9:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It wasn't enough. Research would've counted. Not this :/
Jun 5, 9:12 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's this other guy okay? Aerospace club.
Jun 5, 9:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: His GPA is in the 8s, but he's done loads of shit. He's in IEEE, hosted seminars, app that. He even went to the US to participate in some aerospace competition. Visited NASA and all. He didn't get anywhere.
Jun 5, 9:16 AM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo
Jun 5, 9:16 AM - Yashmitha: So much you typed I thought he'd gotten a crazy place 😋
Jun 5, 9:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: See?
Jun 5, 9:16 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Jun 5, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's too weird. They don't take you for you. They take you for research.
Jun 5, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Or you should apply where they aren't as selective.
Jun 5, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But I'd rather go to the best. Imagine the feeling?
Jun 5, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Stanford or CMU or GaTech or Austin?
Jun 5, 9:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like you're one of the best in the world.
Jun 5, 9:18 AM - Yashmitha: Yeah.. 😔 Especially when everyone is achieving something crazy!
Jun 5, 9:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm.

Jun 5, 9:23 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't mind dropping you. But what I get?
Jun 5, 9:24 AM - Yashmitha: Lol.. You get to see me. And the face on the pimple 😑
Jun 5, 9:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 😁
Jun 5, 9:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You really need me to drop you? Or can I just lie in my bed and not get out? :P
Jun 5, 9:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Just come here no? I'll teach you!!
Jun 5, 9:28 AM - Yashmitha: No notes only.
Jun 5, 9:28 AM - Yashmitha: Lol come no.
Jun 5, 9:28 AM - Yashmitha: It's fun 😋
Jun 5, 9:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: How bad is traffic?
Jun 5, 9:33 AM - Yashmitha: Not bad at all
Jun 5, 9:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If I get stuck in traffic I'll beat your butt. :P
Jun 5, 9:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: When you want to go?
Jun 5, 9:40 AM - Yashmitha: Now re
Jun 5, 9:40 AM - Yashmitha: Come off
Jun 5, 9:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Where I'll meet you?
Jun 5, 9:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: When you say come off should I come now or in 20?
Jun 5, 9:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Because last time I waited for 20 :P
Jun 5, 9:46 AM - Yashmitha: Lol!
Jun 5, 9:46 AM - Yashmitha: I'll tell when to leave
Jun 5, 9:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Bummy.
Jun 5, 9:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You leave now!
Jun 5, 9:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't be a bummy.
Jun 5, 9:46 AM - Yashmitha: No. Wait
Jun 5, 9:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Why wait?
Jun 5, 9:51 AM - Yashmitha: Come now
Jun 5, 9:51 AM - Yashmitha: I'm walking
Jun 5, 9:51 AM - Yashmitha: Inchara
Jun 5, 8:15 PM - Yashmitha: I'm just leaving from college 😭
Jun 5, 8:15 PM - Yashmitha: Soooo much to study!
Jun 5, 8:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh

Jun 5, 8:23 PM - Yashmitha: Thanks for coming to college but! 😄
Jun 5, 8:24 PM - Yashmitha: What did you do agree getting home?
Jun 5, 8:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: 11
Jun 5, 8:24 PM - Yashmitha: Eh?
Jun 5, 8:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh. I did some coding. Worked out.

Jun 5, 8:25 PM - Yashmitha: Oh nice re

Jun 5, 8:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Neural Networks. And some app development
Jun 5, 8:26 PM - Yashmitha: No idea. But sounds like you 😋
Jun 5, 8:45 PM - Yashmitha: Pokey?
Jun 5, 8:45 PM - Yashmitha: You're upset or something?
Jun 5, 8:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why would I be upset?
Jun 5, 8:57 PM - Yashmitha: You don't sound yay
Jun 5, 8:57 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know
Jun 5, 8:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No gratitude, no hug for dropping you. But that's perfectly normal. Nothing to be upset or irritated about.
Jun 5, 9:17 PM - Yashmitha: You left when I was talking about the hug! 😑
Jun 5, 9:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You walked away.
Jun 5, 9:19 PM - Yashmitha: No! I was talking & you just left!
Jun 5, 9:19 PM - Yashmitha: Nonsense?
Jun 5, 9:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, you weren't talking. You said bye..
Jun 5, 9:20 PM - Yashmitha: After which I said I should hug & you just left. Fool
Jun 5, 9:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Obviously?
Jun 5, 9:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you walk away from the tiny one and then realize you've to hug her?
Jun 5, 9:21 PM - Yashmitha: 😑 So what re? I at least realized no?
Jun 5, 9:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Next time.
Jun 5, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If it's not natural, it doesn't mean anything.. Like some protocol this is.
Jun 5, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: Shoo.
Jun 5, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: We don't hug because I usually meet you on the bike only. Lol
Jun 5, 9:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay so?
Jun 5, 9:25 PM - Yashmitha: So we don't hug  😑
Jun 5, 9:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meet me on the bike means?
Jun 5, 9:29 PM - Yashmitha: I don't know how to explain. Lol. It doesn't work like that
Jun 5, 9:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because we travel on the bike we can't hug.
Jun 5, 9:30 PM - Yashmitha: 😑
Jun 5, 9:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Keep your hugs. Save them for people that really matter.
Jun 5, 9:31 PM - Yashmitha: This has become such a huge issue.. And you're the only one to point it out 😅
Jun 5, 9:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who else will point it out?
Jun 5, 9:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what you mean.
Jun 5, 9:52 PM - Yashmitha: That I don't hug
Jun 5, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't hug everyone you mean.
Jun 5, 9:54 PM - Yashmitha: I don't hug anyone. In general. Lol. Only tiny one because she's smaller than me
Jun 5, 9:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And kunal.
Jun 5, 9:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because he's bigger than you.
Jun 5, 9:58 PM - Yashmitha: No. I don't generally hug him 😂
Jun 5, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ah.
Jun 5, 10:01 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. I really don't.. Ask anyone. I'm never huggy 😂
Jun 5, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay!
Jun 5, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Forget it!
Jun 5, 10:03 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo
Jun 5, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not worth it.
Jun 5, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not worth it. I'm fighting you for you. What's wrong with me?
Jun 5, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The sad part is you don't really give a damn.
Jun 5, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm just embarrassing myself.
Jun 5, 10:06 PM - Yashmitha: You know what? I don't care anymore if you think that. I do my best & I know I treat you well. You have issues. If it's so hard, just stop. I can't take this.
Jun 5, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Obviously I'll think like that? Who wouldn't? You keep me away from all your other friends. You don't usually meet me till you want or need something. 
You never listen to anything I say. And you're always criticizing me..
Jun 5, 10:18 PM - Yashmitha: I don't keep you away!
Jun 5, 10:18 PM - Yashmitha: What shit? 😑
Jun 5, 10:18 PM - Yashmitha: You've met them!
Jun 5, 10:18 PM - Yashmitha: Mrunal. Kunal. Ayisha. Rithima.
Jun 5, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: Simply you feel bad re.. I don't like it.
Jun 5, 10:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I don't like this.. I don't feel close to you at all. And I don't like it that way.
Jun 5, 10:29 PM - Yashmitha: 😕 How much effort do I need to put into this?
Jun 5, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why does it feel like you've to put in effort?
Jun 5, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You think if I asked you for what you asked me today you'd do it?
Jun 5, 10:30 PM - Yashmitha: Because the normal me doesn't hug. 😕
Jun 5, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'd make it about effort, about how you're lazy, etc etc.
Jun 5, 10:31 PM - Yashmitha: I would! You don't ask!
Jun 5, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah?
Jun 5, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Jun 5, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: I accompanied you to college once just because 😕
Jun 5, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Which year was that in?
Jun 5, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: Arvind's birthday
Jun 5, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not the same! This was a favor. That was me wanting to hang out with you.
Jun 5, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Think about it. Think about what I was like previously, and what I'm like now. See if you feel like there's any difference.
Jun 5, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do I text as much? Do I call at all?
Jun 5, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do I ask you to meet?
Jun 5, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This is dying..
Jun 5, 10:36 PM - Yashmitha: It's not. It's been this way for three years. Have we gotten bored?
Jun 5, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Have YOU gotten bored?
Jun 5, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because even though I don't do those things, I don't do them consciously.
Jun 5, 10:38 PM - Yashmitha: No. That's what I'm saying.
Jun 5, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I know I won't get a response.
Jun 5, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't do them because that's how I want it to be. I do it coz otherwise I'll end up feeling bad.
Jun 5, 10:40 PM - Yashmitha: ❤
Jun 5, 10:40 PM - Yashmitha: You don't get a response it seems.
Jun 5, 10:40 PM - Yashmitha: Irritating
Jun 5, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I really don't. You won't pick up my call or you'll be out with someone else already. You won't be able to go out. You don't like to Skype or talk on the phone. You sleep at 10-11 when you're messaging me.
Jun 5, 10:45 PM - Yashmitha: None of this is planned. You know that no?
Jun 5, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Of course not. But I also know that you really don't want any of those things either.
Jun 5, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because I've seen how you're a different person with other people. You're always up for anything.. I told you no? I feel like I'm competing with everyone else, and I'm losing :/
Jun 5, 10:47 PM - Yashmitha: You're the only person I talk to every single day. I think that's some sort of affection??
Jun 5, 10:49 PM - Yashmitha: You're not competing. I'm different with you? No I'm not 😐
Jun 5, 10:49 PM - Yashmitha: I'm happy with you! Isn't that app that matters?
Jun 5, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what to say..
Jun 5, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mostly I'm left feeling like you're holding back or something. Coz you're so talkative and animated when there's someone else.
Jun 5, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And so quiet with me. Even when I'm all excited and chatty.
Jun 5, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You really do make me feel like I'm not good enough for you.
Jun 5, 11:03 PM - Yashmitha: It's never about that & I can never say that about you.
Jun 5, 11:04 PM - Yashmitha: It's me! I've not even achieved anything. Neither am I a flawless beauty or extremely clever. Who's not good enough? 😂
Jun 5, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The way you make me feel suggests something completely different :P
Jun 5, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've got too much of a spell on me.
Jun 5, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: Oho 😉
Jun 5, 11:05 PM - Yashmitha: That's only coz of how much you mean to me
Jun 5, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How much you mean to me!
Jun 5, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't have a spell on you.
Jun 5, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: You do.
Jun 5, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: I can't stay away
Jun 5, 11:07 PM - Yashmitha: Although for one month in July, I'm disappearing 😝
Jun 5, 11:08 PM - Yashmitha: There'll be no you.. I need to brace myself & learn things 😂
Jun 5, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Disappearing?
Jun 5, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah. From communication
Jun 5, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: I need to do that
Jun 5, 11:10 PM - Yashmitha: I'm so messed up
Jun 5, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: From who? From everyone?
Jun 5, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah!
Jun 5, 11:12 PM - Yashmitha: Lol you think only you?
Jun 5, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah I thought me only :P
Jun 5, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was going to say - as though that's any different from some of the days we have right now :?
Jun 5, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :p

Jun 5, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Irritating it is.
Jun 5, 11:52 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo 😕
Jun 5, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I usually tell her to sleep. Today she's up.
Jun 5, 11:52 PM - Yashmitha: Hehe. Why today?
Jun 5, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told her about how this is not serious and why it shouldn't be serious.
Jun 5, 11:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Needed to bring that up
Jun 5, 11:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just to make sure no one misunderstands

Jun 5, 11:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why?

Jun 7, 10:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's people like me that take the world forward.
Jun 7, 10:34 AM - Yashmitha: Never denied 😋

Jun 7, 10:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's no right or wrong missy. There's no black or white. There's only grey.

Jun 7, 9:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why no new clothes for you?
Jun 7, 9:05 PM - Yashmitha: Simply 😒
Jun 7, 9:05 PM - Yashmitha: Poverty.
Jun 7, 9:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Jun 7, 9:08 PM - Yashmitha: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jun 7, 9:09 PM - Yashmitha: Who did this?
Jun 7, 9:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Aanchal and manika.

Jun 7, 9:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. Went to her place for sometime.
Jun 7, 9:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No privacy and all.
Jun 7, 9:10 PM - Yashmitha: Don't lie 😋
Jun 7, 9:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Seriously. We were sitting in Aanchal's living room.
Jun 7, 9:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Her brother and sister also were there.
Jun 7, 9:11 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo
Jun 7, 9:11 PM - Yashmitha: 😝
Jun 7, 9:11 PM - Yashmitha: Didn't go out after?
Jun 7, 9:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re.. Dropped her off.
Jun 7, 9:15 PM - Yashmitha: Aiyyo.. Why?
Jun 7, 9:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Irritating re. Family.
Jun 7, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: Oh
Jun 7, 9:22 PM - Yashmitha: Should have gone somewhere instead of Aanchal:'s house
Jun 7, 9:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No re.
Jun 7, 9:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She went and ate at home.
Jun 7, 9:32 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. So weird
Jun 7, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yesh.
Jun 7, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *Yeah
Jun 7, 9:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not after, I meant she'd eaten lunch at 4. Then she said she really really needs to get back. So I just went and dropped her off. It gets irritating sometimes.
Jun 7, 9:44 PM - Yashmitha: Oh.. Hey, it's hard on her
Jun 7, 9:44 PM - Yashmitha: Don't judge..
Jun 7, 9:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can't let others run your life!
Jun 7, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Her parents left her in chikmaglur and came to bangalore to hang out.
Jun 7, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They're at orion, watching movies, getting food.
Jun 7, 9:45 PM - Yashmitha: Then you should have just gone there!! 😝
Jun 7, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But they want her to sit at home?
Jun 7, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And she's supposed to just accept that?
Jun 7, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And make me also accept it?
Jun 7, 9:46 PM - Yashmitha: You have a choice.. She doesn't have much of one in India
Jun 7, 9:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's nonsense. No? Shouldn't she stand up to shit like this?
Jun 7, 9:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you know, her mom spends 5k+ on salon treatments every month? Manika only gets 2k or so money to spend while she's in the hostel.
Jun 7, 9:47 PM - Yashmitha: Shit.. 2k???
Jun 7, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some shit like that. It's horrible.
Jun 7, 9:48 PM - Yashmitha: What on earth can she do with so little?
Jun 7, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's all like that.
Jun 7, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Obviously I'll get angry?
Jun 7, 10:11 PM - Yashmitha: You never believed me when I said girls don't get freedom..
Jun 7, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But do you see how irrational this is?
Jun 7, 10:14 PM - Yashmitha: I do. It's all like that. There's one girl. Parents forced her into marriage. Our classmate at Cottons.
Jun 7, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No one can force you into anything. Can they?
Jun 7, 10:16 PM - Yashmitha: They can. Emotional drama!
Jun 7, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What sort of emotional drama?
Jun 7, 10:21 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. They'll find something. You have no idea
Jun 7, 10:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Really? Give me an example?
Jun 7, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Get married early. Your dad's health condition is so bad. His only wish is to see you married.
Jun 7, 10:25 PM - Yashmitha: Can you say anything?
Jun 7, 10:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But is the father really sick?
Jun 7, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What if the person is aware that this isn't true?
Jun 7, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Tell me one thing, how long can someone live for others' whims and fancies?
Jun 7, 10:30 PM - Yashmitha: It's usually true!
Jun 7, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm
Jun 7, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: And they expect that. Parents
Jun 7, 10:32 PM - Yashmitha: Until a few years ago, I too had too many restrictions
Jun 7, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And then?
Jun 7, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: I stopped caring.
Jun 7, 10:33 PM - Yashmitha: About a few things. Which I found unreasonable.
Jun 7, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You fought?
Jun 7, 10:35 PM - Yashmitha: But I listen to the ones that make sense. "Don't stay out late unless you have someone dropping you"
Jun 7, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah..
Jun 7, 10:39 PM - Yashmitha: Yeah
Jun 7, 10:39 PM - Yashmitha: I didn't fight. I just did my own thing
Jun 7, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's when you stopped caring about me also :P
Jun 7, 10:42 PM - Yashmitha: What rubbish. Simply 😕
Jun 7, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Very annoyed tonight.
Jun 7, 10:50 PM - Yashmitha: It's okay love.. Really
Jun 7, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not okay. I stayed away from all this for so long because of this very reason. Stupid families.
Jun 7, 10:51 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. All girls had the same issue! Annie. Me. Shruti. Now Manika 😕
Jun 7, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I remember, on the train to surathkal, I even told aanchal this. About why I don't have anyone.
Jun 7, 10:51 PM - Yashmitha: Aww?
Jun 7, 10:52 PM - Yashmitha: Some girls don't have too many issues re.
Jun 7, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But then I went back on my word and that was so stupid of me!
Jun 7, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm so angry. Mostly at myself!
Jun 7, 10:52 PM - Yashmitha: It's really not your fault..
Jun 7, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All the girls had issues with me. Not in general.
Jun 7, 10:53 PM - Yashmitha: Don't regret things so much.. Life is too short for that
Jun 7, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, you forgot Rishika. Same thing.
Jun 7, 10:53 PM - Yashmitha: What rubbish??
Jun 7, 10:53 PM - Yashmitha: What issue Manika has with you?
Jun 7, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: To be with me there was a problem, but to be out in general, no issue at all.
Jun 7, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All except mabika
Jun 7, 10:54 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Being with a boy is different from being out in general 😅
Jun 7, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You bring friends, you make plans with others, you do what you've got to do.. People make it work.
Jun 7, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's all about what you want and how much you want it..
Jun 7, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's a reality okay? No one can deny that. That's a reality for each one of those girls.
Jun 7, 10:56 PM - Yashmitha: Hmm. I gave up hanging out with my friends for you. Please 😂
Jun 7, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't start now :/ please..
Jun 7, 10:57 PM - Yashmitha: Hello. I'm justifying your Nonsense accusations.
Jun 7, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who accused? How did I accuse you?
Jun 7, 10:58 PM - Yashmitha: You just did.. About how it's about bring friends. Making it work if you really want it
Jun 7, 10:58 PM - Yashmitha: You didn't want to hang out with mine
Jun 7, 10:58 PM - Yashmitha: You didn't even want me to hang out with them.
Jun 7, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fine.. I'm sorry.
Jun 7, 11:01 PM - Yashmitha: You're not friend with Shruti on Fb anymore?
Jun 7, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. Why?
Jun 7, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe she removed me.
Jun 7, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I haven't checked.
Jun 7, 11:02 PM - Yashmitha: I don't think you are. Lol. I just saw she has only one mutual friend with me & it's not you
Jun 7, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know why that is. She hasn't removed me.
Jun 7, 11:06 PM - Yashmitha: Lol. Okay
Jun 7, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm.
Jun 7, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know I've made mistakes okay? But just once, when I try to do it right, things should go my way.. But I feel like it's never ever going to happen.
Jun 7, 11:25 PM - Yashmitha: You know bub.. Things sometimes really don't work out.. But if you can make yourself special enough for the person to find it hard to let you go, even if they have to, you can say you're on the positive side
Jun 7, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what that means
Jun 7, 11:26 PM - Yashmitha: It just means it's important that you make a mark & you're not easy to let go of
Jun 7, 11:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We're sending my grandma on a tour of Europe okay? So much effort to get the visa
Jun 7, 11:27 PM - Yashmitha: Ushoo!! Who's sending?
Jun 7, 11:27 PM - Yashmitha: Who's going with her?

Jun 7, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mad? Its way too costly :P
