Jan 26, 9:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Remember how ambika made us do the review paper on word?
Jan 26, 9:33 PM - Manika: Yes
Jan 26, 9:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Worst mistake you can make! No one ever does that outside apparently
Jan 26, 9:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They all use Latex
Jan 26, 9:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Same with project reports and papers.
Jan 26, 9:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Easier to format and arrange
Jan 26, 9:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Word is meant only for text
Jan 26, 9:34 PM - Manika: Okay...these teachers don't know anything.
Jan 26, 9:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's changing though, very rapidly. They're pushing people to do research
Jan 26, 9:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The expectation from the projects also has been raised
Jan 26, 9:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's good for the department.
Jan 26, 9:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At least they're showing some ambition. I like that
Jan 26, 9:37 PM - Manika: Then good!

Jan 26, 9:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't think i can teach
Jan 26, 9:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But that's coz i don't think I have the patience
Jan 26, 9:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If that isn't a problem for someone, I'd do it. Coz the pay is good. But I want to start a company of my own more than anything else.
Jan 26, 9:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Something important and different. Not a taxi app or social network or anything. Something useful.
Jan 26, 9:46 PM - Manika: I can actually imagine you starting a company.
Jan 26, 9:46 PM - Manika: It's so difficult being a Muslim...pity them.
Jan 26, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, I guess it is.. Sucks that the world is like that 
But their practices make them stick out. Everyone else has evolved but they refuse to
Jan 26, 9:50 PM - Manika: Yeah....thank god I am not a Muslim.
Jan 26, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wish more of them wanted to be different.
Jan 26, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like that aspect of region. The fanaticism. The logic is so flawed but they'll still right.

Jan 28, 9:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh you got to HR round?
Jan 28, 9:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They expect you to hang around after 3 years? That's ridiculous
Jan 28, 9:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Should've said that you're not interested. Or that you're into business. That's why you applied.

Feb 22, 11:12 AM - Manika: Have to go back to the hostel
Feb 22, 11:13 AM - Manika: I thought of it last night.
Feb 22, 11:13 AM - Manika: But then everyone is petty serious about these internals.
Feb 22, 11:13 AM - Manika: Pretty*
Feb 22, 11:14 AM - Manika: After internals.
Feb 22, 11:14 AM - Manika: üòÉ

Feb 22, 11:20 AM - Manika: He was in college till 8:00 yesterday.
Feb 22, 11:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Coz he's just a drunk these days.
Feb 22, 11:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Absolutely useless.
Feb 22, 11:20 AM - Manika: Oh n the other quizzes ?

Feb 22, 11:23 AM - Manika: But he said he was drunk
Feb 22, 11:23 AM - Manika: N had plans of drinking again
Feb 22, 11:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Sick of all that. I don't know if he thinks it's cool or he's just addicted.
Feb 22, 11:29 AM - Manika: Why don't you talk to him about it??
Feb 22, 11:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: People have spoken. He doesn't seem to care.
Feb 22, 11:31 AM - Manika: Ahhhh.
Feb 22, 11:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: People should stop encouraging but.
Feb 22, 11:32 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I almost never go drinking with him.
Feb 22, 11:32 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Like Ritu and all his other friends, they shouldn't call him for all this and stuff. He has a problem.
Feb 22, 11:33 AM - Manika: That's one way of stopping him from drinking.
Feb 22, 11:33 AM - Manika: Why does he drink that much?
Feb 22, 11:33 AM - Manika: His friends would have realised by now.
Feb 22, 11:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: They have! They mock it all the time, but it doesn't seem to matter

Feb 22, 11:38 AM - Manika: <Media omitted>
Feb 22, 11:40 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Pink sister!
Feb 22, 11:42 AM - Manika: That's how they address all their mails n messages üòÇ
Feb 22, 11:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Sort of weird :P
Feb 22, 11:42 AM - Manika: They at least dint call us pinkys üòã
Feb 22, 11:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What was the objective of this run?
Feb 22, 11:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What was the prize money?
Feb 22, 11:42 AM - Manika: Pinkathon
Feb 22, 11:43 AM - Manika: Breast cancer awareness
Feb 22, 11:43 AM - Manika: No prize money...they were giving out trophies
Feb 22, 11:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I wouldn't have run then :P
Feb 22, 11:43 AM - Manika: There was a Zumba class for an hour before the run
Feb 22, 11:43 AM - Manika: It was so funnyüòÉ

Feb 22, 11:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm in no shape to run

Feb 22, 11:47 AM - Manika: Start now n then you will be able to run.

Feb 22, 12:44 PM - Manika: You should find someone like that.
Feb 22, 12:50 PM - Manika: It seems like all the startup's succeed.
Feb 22, 1:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Lots don't, so obviously no one tells their story :P
Feb 22, 1:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like history. Have you heard of how only the victor's story is told? When a war happens and one side wins, it conquers the other side. There's almost never any neutral party to record what happens so only the victorious side's account gets recorded. It's usually very biased.
Feb 22, 1:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The whole of history is like that.
Feb 22, 1:39 PM - Manika: Makes sense...the world will know your story only if you are successful.
Feb 22, 1:39 PM - Manika: I am so sleepy now.
Feb 22, 1:40 PM - Manika: Il study from 3:00.
Feb 22, 1:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Me too!

Feb 22, 5:09 PM - Manika: That Pom Pom dog?
Feb 22, 5:10 PM - Manika: I have to still start iprüòî
Feb 22, 5:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The problem is finishing
Feb 22, 5:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's scary, coz most of it is quoted from the Act and he won't give any marks for using your own language :/
Feb 22, 5:42 PM - Manika: From where are you studying?
Feb 22, 5:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The text for now
Feb 22, 5:53 PM - Manika: He has sent us notes also.
Feb 22, 5:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Looks like I'll need to study from there
Feb 22, 5:55 PM - Manika: I am studying from the notes.
Feb 22, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Teach IPR?
Feb 22, 11:42 PM - Manika: üò≠üò≠
Feb 22, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
Feb 22, 11:42 PM - Manika: Il teach you project management
Feb 22, 11:42 PM - Manika: You teach ipr.
Feb 22, 11:42 PM - Manika: Il fell asleep.
Feb 22, 11:43 PM - Manika: I*
Feb 22, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Look, intellect is what differentiates us from other living beings
Feb 22, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: People realised that ideas need to be protected and rewarded
Feb 22, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Therefore, to foster growth and development, they came up with IPR
Feb 22, 11:44 PM - Manika: Okay continue.
Feb 22, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: These rights grant you a monopoly over your invention. People that want to use it need to license it from you. If they don't they can be prosecuted. That's the gist of the story.
Feb 22, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So this way, everyone wants to think and create and patent first. So they have monopoly and the others need to pay them to do something with the concept.
Feb 22, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But since you can't let monopolies last forever, because then people will get lazy and stop being inventive and so on, the patent expires after 20 years.
Feb 22, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then anyone can use the concept and make anything without need for licensing.
Feb 22, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So that's what the subject is all about
Feb 22, 11:49 PM - Manika: I thought you would continue and cover each and every pointüòî
Feb 22, 11:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
Feb 22, 11:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: His notes are very brief
Feb 22, 11:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just learn those?
Feb 22, 11:49 PM - Manika: And it's enough??
Feb 22, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The evolution bit is like a story. That should come.
Feb 22, 11:50 PM - Manika: Tomorrow morning il wake up n study
Feb 22, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And the underlying principles of patent law

Feb 22, 11:55 PM - Manika: Really... Neither do I.

Feb 22, 11:56 PM - Manika: You still studying ??
Feb 22, 11:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm giving people life advice :P
Feb 22, 11:57 PM - Manika: Hahahaha
Feb 22, 11:57 PM - Manika: What advice?
Feb 22, 11:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So there are these two families that are really close. One guy got a new girlfriend, and in the other family there's a girl that he used to treat like his sister. Now she's upset that he doesn't spend time with her anymore.
Feb 23, 12:02 AM - Manika: And what advice did you give?
Feb 23, 12:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I told her to tell him.
Feb 23, 12:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Because new relationships shouldn't change everything else that previously existed
Feb 23, 12:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: They had a long discussion apparently

Feb 23, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The notes kaushal gave doesn't have waterfall model and agile and all :/
Feb 24, 6:10 AM - Manika: That  notes doesn't have half the topics.
Feb 24, 7:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The text has the exact topics from the syllabus, but nothing she did in class :/

Feb 24, 7:26 PM - Manika: Big m n two phase method?
Feb 24, 7:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Two phase I know what needs to be done
Feb 24, 7:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But again, I don't know the final step
Feb 24, 7:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Similarly, big M, I know what to choose as M
Feb 24, 7:27 PM - Manika: Oh that's easy.
Feb 24, 7:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Couple of things I do not know. But small steps. I'll look it up online.

Feb 24, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Isn't that place bad?
Feb 24, 10:44 PM - Manika: <Media omitted>
Feb 24, 10:45 PM - Manika: It's okay but they deliver within 15 mins
Feb 24, 10:45 PM - Manika: N cherry had to leave early.
Feb 24, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's a rat?
Feb 24, 10:47 PM - Manika: That's a catüòÇ
Feb 24, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It looked really small so I just assumed :P
Feb 24, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So there's this dog on the street outside my place, it gave birth to a litter. Those puppies are so adorable!
Feb 24, 10:56 PM - Manika: So cuteeeüòç
Feb 24, 10:57 PM - Manika: Get one pup !!!
Feb 24, 10:57 PM - Manika: Take care of them

Feb 24, 10:58 PM - Manika: Don't forgetüòÉ
Feb 24, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But we really don't need more dogs on the street :/
Feb 24, 10:58 PM - Manika: They will be nice to you
Feb 24, 10:59 PM - Manika: I am gonna check all my application status now
Feb 24, 10:59 PM - Manika: Fingers crossedüòÅ
Feb 24, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They always email!
Feb 24, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I check sometimes, but actually there's no point :/
Feb 24, 11:01 PM - Manika: Ahhhh
Feb 24, 11:09 PM - Manika: One university says application under committee review
Feb 24, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The others?
Feb 24, 11:11 PM - Manika: Checking.
Feb 24, 11:15 PM - Manika: The other universities havnt put up anything.
Feb 24, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't worry about it
Feb 24, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Plenty of time time to go üòä
Feb 24, 11:57 PM - Manika: By march at least I should know the status.
Feb 24, 11:57 PM - Manika: Goodnight Sonal.
Feb 25, 5:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Morning!
Feb 25, 9:50 PM - Manika: I got a reject from UW-Madison.
Feb 25, 9:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh!
Feb 25, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't know you'd applied there
Feb 25, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't worry, you've applied to enough to make sure you'll get in somewhere üòä
Feb 25, 9:57 PM - Manika: This feels so horrible.
Feb 25, 9:57 PM - Manika: I dint apply to UT Dallas also.
Feb 25, 9:58 PM - Manika: N my for ncsu it says late application.
Feb 25, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Dallas had already started responding. If you applied it would've just been a waste of money.
Feb 25, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How come?
Feb 25, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You applied late?
Feb 25, 9:59 PM - Manika: I paid the application fee one day before the deadline
Feb 25, 9:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's not late. Is it? I don't know what their procedure is. Maybe you should write and clarify?
Feb 25, 10:00 PM - Manika: I sent them a mail but they dint reply.
Feb 25, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mail the admissions office with your application number or code
Feb 25, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When did you email?
Feb 25, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It could take up to a few days
Feb 25, 10:02 PM - Manika: I mailed them in December only.
Feb 25, 10:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Try again no?
Feb 25, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What does the FAQ say about such a status?
Feb 25, 10:05 PM - Manika: I checked it long back...it said if there is time they will go through the late applications
Feb 25, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh..
Feb 25, 10:05 PM - Manika: Il mail them again??
Feb 25, 10:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mail and ask. Were you actually late though?
Feb 25, 10:06 PM - Manika: No cause I paid the fees one day before..
Feb 25, 10:07 PM - Manika: It says 14th on the fee payment receipt also.
Feb 25, 10:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You would've got the confirmation.
Feb 25, 10:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Send them that no? How can they say you've paid late?
Feb 25, 10:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Should've done this back then itself.
Feb 25, 10:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Attach it to the email
Feb 25, 10:08 PM - Manika: It's already feb....I am so late.
Feb 25, 10:08 PM - Manika: Il mail them anyways.
Feb 25, 10:10 PM - Manika: Northeastern is my safe university...many have got replies but I havnt got one till now.
Feb 25, 10:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: EC people got?
Feb 25, 10:10 PM - Manika: If I dint get there I dunno what to do.
Feb 25, 10:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Same department you sent to?
Feb 25, 10:11 PM - Manika: Yes
Feb 25, 10:11 PM - Manika: Dont*
Feb 25, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The department should send out their results to everyone all at once 
What does the site say? Under review?
Feb 25, 10:13 PM - Manika: Yeah it says under review.
Feb 25, 10:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Who got replies?
Feb 25, 10:13 PM - Manika: They have sent it out for CS not EC.
Feb 25, 10:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then EC is not done yet.
Feb 25, 10:14 PM - Manika: Ok.
Feb 25, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't worry okay? I know you'll get in!
Feb 25, 11:25 PM - Manika: Hopefully somewhere.
Feb 25, 11:25 PM - Manika: You will also get in!
Feb 25, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I doubt that. I underestimated the fact that I want to switch branches. I fear I may not have justified being chosen over someone else who's done CS before.
Feb 25, 11:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I chose to believe that everyone will be evaluated at the same level but now I don't think it'll be like that :/
Feb 25, 11:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If it wasn't like that I think I should've got CMU
Feb 25, 11:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know.. I feel weird
Feb 25, 11:30 PM - Manika: Getting a reject from one college doesn't mean that the rest of them are also gonna reject you.
Feb 25, 11:30 PM - Manika: The other universities might like your profile.
Feb 25, 11:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Two rejects :P
Feb 25, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But yeah, it's not over till it's over
Feb 25, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm.. Fingers crossed!
Feb 25, 11:31 PM - Manika: Yeah that's what I am telling myself
Feb 25, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What others are left?
Feb 25, 11:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Northeastern, NCSU?
Feb 25, 11:32 PM - Manika: Purdue,Washington,cmu,nyu,ucsd
Feb 25, 11:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Washington where?
Feb 25, 11:33 PM - Manika: Washington state
Feb 25, 11:33 PM - Manika: I have to tell my parents tomorrow that I got a reject.
Feb 25, 11:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Pulman?
Feb 25, 11:34 PM - Manika: Ahh
Feb 25, 11:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't have to tell them. Wait a bit?
Feb 25, 11:34 PM - Manika: Seattle.
Feb 25, 11:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then you mean University of Washington
Feb 25, 11:35 PM - Manika: No I tell them....I simply don't want to keep heir hopes high
Feb 25, 11:36 PM - Manika: Yes....way ambitious for me
Feb 25, 11:36 PM - Manika: But I applied.
Feb 25, 11:36 PM - Manika: Their*
Feb 25, 11:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm :/ I wish information was more easily available
Feb 25, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's such a huge gap! Don't know where to apply, what they look for, if the place you apply to even makes sense for your career ambitious
Feb 25, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ambitions
Feb 25, 11:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought India was bad :/
Feb 25, 11:39 PM - Manika: I don't remember what I was thinking when I chose the universities.
Feb 25, 11:39 PM - Manika: Listen....what could be the reason for me not getting an admit.
Feb 25, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Scores were up to the mark.
Feb 25, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe the fit?
Feb 25, 11:40 PM - Manika: GRE score,sop or cgpa wasn't good enough?
Feb 25, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe the course that you want to do isn't present there?
Feb 25, 11:40 PM - Manika: The course was Present there.
Feb 25, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think Madison would've required high 320s though. I'm just guessing.
Feb 25, 11:41 PM - Manika: Oh
Feb 25, 11:41 PM - Manika: Could be a reason.
Feb 25, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In a lot of cases what happens is more experienced candidates apply.
Feb 25, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then it's not in your hands at all.
Feb 25, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They'll get the best to pick from so they can afford to be very selective.
Feb 25, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Madison offers grants to everyone so it's cheap. Everyone tries to get in there if possible :/
Feb 25, 11:43 PM - Manika: Ahhhh.
Feb 25, 11:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe a vlsi related internship or paper could've helped :/ it certainly would've changed my profile completely!
Feb 25, 11:44 PM - Manika: I can't do much now...have to just wait now.
Feb 25, 11:44 PM - Manika: I don't like waiting n getting rejected.
Feb 25, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Think about how you'll better yourself before applying again next year, just in case..
Feb 25, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what even I've been doing
Feb 25, 11:45 PM - Manika: I think I should start thinking about that.
Feb 25, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It happens, and that can't be helped, coz we're from BMS :/
Feb 25, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But there's definitely ways to improve before reapplying
Feb 25, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Research experience really helps
Feb 25, 11:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: See if you can get that somehow?
Feb 25, 11:46 PM - Manika: I should get some good internship before applying again.
Feb 25, 11:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah.
Feb 25, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Preferably research.
Feb 25, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Get a paper somehow.
Feb 25, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It makes a world of difference!
Feb 25, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The more the better. Then you can actually say that you want this so bad when you write the LOR. And that you've done so much to better yourself.
Feb 25, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It also helps you decide and be more specific in the LOR.
Feb 25, 11:49 PM - Manika: After college gets over i am all on my own.
Feb 25, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Meaning what?
Feb 25, 11:50 PM - Manika: As in where il go searching for jobs n insternships
Feb 25, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Use contacts!
Feb 25, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mojo actually knows someone who does vlsi
Feb 25, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some small company. They do custom board fabrication.
Feb 25, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe get to someone at IISc through prableen's dad and offer to work for a year there?
Feb 25, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Might work out.
Feb 25, 11:53 PM - Manika: Okay il talk to Prableen n mojo
Feb 25, 11:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: College actually does nothing for you. Placement cell just wants to say it's placed everyone. They don't care what sort of job.
Feb 25, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So it's actually way better outside. At least you get to choose stuff you like. And don't have to pay 8.5k for it.
Feb 25, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll be okay! Lots of people go through this every year, just don't give up üòä
Feb 25, 11:57 PM - Manika: üòå
Feb 25, 11:58 PM - Manika: Thank you....you give honest opinions.
Feb 25, 11:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòä
Feb 26, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Go to sleep now. ISRO tomorrow!
Feb 26, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: All the best. Goodnight!
Feb 26, 12:00 AM - Manika: Goodnight.
Feb 26, 2:06 PM - Manika: We dint go to Isro today.
Feb 26, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How come?
Feb 26, 2:21 PM - Manika: Prableen n aisha weren't gonna come today
Feb 26, 2:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Feb 26, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why not?

Mar 19, 8:25 AM - Manika: We watch these YouTube videos and dance.
Mar 19, 8:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But everyone says he's generally like that.
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: KPL was convinced.
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mekali also.
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Manika: Did he ask you all to make any changes?
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He asked why we aren't doing it on hardware
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Manika: Ohhh then good...cause usually Kpl doesn't give marks.
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We have enough to work with as it is. There's no need to do it on hardware!
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Manika: Are you doing it in the hardware?
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Manika: On*
Mar 19, 8:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He's just pissed off coz we said IISc.
Mar 19, 8:27 AM - Manika: Ohhh
Mar 19, 8:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No, hardware is too expensive.
Mar 19, 8:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The devices are $100 each
Mar 19, 8:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And we need 50-100
Mar 19, 8:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: This is quality research work. I don't understand what their problem is.

Mar 19, 8:28 AM - Manika: 6000 is affordable.
Mar 19, 8:29 AM - Manika: üòÇ
Mar 19, 8:29 AM - Manika: So lazy !
Mar 19, 8:29 AM - Manika: Harish?
Mar 19, 8:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: 6 lakhs is not affordable :P
Mar 19, 8:29 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We need about 50. Otherwise how do you show a network?
Mar 19, 8:30 AM - Manika: Ohh you need 100 devices üòú

Mar 19, 8:30 AM - Manika: You can buy 50 final year projects with that money
Mar 19, 8:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's messed up.
Mar 19, 8:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If they have a problem with the topic or the approach they should schedule something in the beginning to evaluate what your topic and approach are.
Mar 19, 8:31 AM - Manika: What's messed up?
Mar 19, 8:31 AM - Manika: <Media omitted>

Mar 19, 8:32 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Looks like it's photoshopped!
Mar 19, 8:32 AM - Manika: Sudhindra has a problem with your project topic now??
Mar 19, 8:32 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah
Mar 19, 8:33 AM - Manika: He should have informed you about it in the beginning.
Mar 19, 8:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the guide's responsibility isn't it? He's the one that accepts or rejects the project in the first place. The reviewer should ideally only look at how the person's gone about achieving that target.
Mar 19, 8:36 AM - Manika: Hod scrapped Vinneth's project after the first review.
Mar 19, 8:36 AM - Manika: He has joined a new group now b

Mar 19, 8:38 AM - Manika: And that professor was the Hod of the electronics department in iisc.

Apr 2, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know we asked them to show us quizzes before hosting?
Apr 2, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They refused. We wanted to go over questions and all that once.

Apr 2, 10:37 PM - Manika: Hahaha..weird juniors.
Apr 2, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why we didn't work this year. For utsav or for the quiz fest.

Apr 2, 10:45 PM - Manika: It sucked!
Apr 2, 10:45 PM - Manika: No one was funny.

Apr 5, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: By giving up I mean I'll never go and get something myself.
Apr 5, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like I won't drink alone or anything
Apr 5, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But when I'm out, and everyone's drinking, it'll be hard for me to say no
Apr 5, 10:21 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe that's the challenge.
Apr 5, 10:22 PM - Manika: That will be difficult !

Apr 11, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's the first place on the blog
Apr 11, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Recommend making a reservation it seems. The guy told us fifteen minutes, an hour later we walked away.
Apr 11, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Still wasn't our turn.
Apr 11, 10:47 PM - Manika: Next time reserve a place !

Apr 11, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently the food is really good
Apr 11, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Their setup is really stupid. They put two people on four people tables
Apr 11, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They should get smaller tables or a bigger place. Or they should just refuse to serve people. Not make them wait.
Apr 11, 10:51 PM - Manika: There are too many places in indiranagar
Apr 11, 10:51 PM - Manika: They should not take reservations at all
Apr 11, 10:51 PM - Manika: Simple.

Apr 11, 10:51 PM - Manika: If the ace is full
Apr 11, 10:51 PM - Manika: Place*
Apr 11, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Imagine you're really busy but you want to try this place. To ensure you're not disappointed, having to wait and not get a table, reserve
Apr 11, 10:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They should've just gotten a bigger place. This one is like HOD's room.
Apr 11, 10:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its so small!
Apr 11, 10:53 PM - Manika: No let them take reservations but if the place is small they should take only limited bookings

Apr 11, 11:05 PM - Manika: Oh
Apr 11, 11:05 PM - Manika: Do you follow all of them ?

Apr 11, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know some people whose life is all about prayer
Apr 11, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And it makes sense to them somehow
Apr 11, 11:11 PM - Manika: I want to pray everyday but I end up praying only when I need something or when I am in trouble.

Apr 15, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's okay, that's a good thing
Apr 15, 10:40 PM - Manika: Solve the question I sent on the group v
Apr 15, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No idea :/
Apr 15, 10:56 PM - Manika: It was put up on some group.
Apr 15, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You didn't get it?
Apr 15, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought it had to do with the number that only appears once. But there are two numbers like that.
Apr 15, 10:58 PM - Manika: It's 16th July.
Apr 15, 10:59 PM - Manika: What you doing now?
Apr 15, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think I sort of got it
Apr 15, 11:06 PM - Manika: Explain
Apr 15, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So in the beginning bernard doesn't know right? That's what the first statement says.
Apr 15, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That means that whatever date was chosen occurs in more than one month.
Apr 15, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So two options can be eliminated
Apr 15, 11:09 PM - Manika: Yeah and after that ??
Apr 15, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So if Albert knows that much, then he should know that may and june aren't the right months
Apr 15, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because that's the only way he can know that bernard doesn't know
Apr 15, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Got it?
Apr 15, 11:13 PM - Manika: Yes
Apr 15, 11:13 PM - Manika: July and August is left.
Apr 15, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: After that it's simple. Bernard then says that he knows now.
Apr 15, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So that means whatever date he was told occurs only once.
Apr 15, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The two 14s can be removed
Apr 15, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Finally Albert also says he knows. Which means that whatever month he was told only occurs once.
Apr 15, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why July.
Apr 15, 11:16 PM - Manika: Okay I understood now. üòÖ
Apr 15, 11:17 PM - Manika: üëèüëèüëè
Apr 15, 11:17 PM - Manika: Awesome.
Apr 15, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I started off right thinking about the numbers without any pairs but then I got stuck
Apr 15, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't remove the months in the first step, couldn't proceed. After I learned that, the rest was easy.
Apr 15, 11:20 PM - Manika: Woow!
Apr 15, 11:20 PM - Manika: Too smart you are c
Apr 15, 11:21 PM - Manika: How did you eliminate May and June ?
Apr 15, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I searched for the problem online üôà
Apr 15, 11:22 PM - Manika: Ehhh...Sonal !
Apr 15, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay that step, I got everythig else!
Apr 15, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I got stuck, and I had to know
Apr 15, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like not knowing
Apr 15, 11:23 PM - Manika: Hahaha...now you know how to solve the problem
Apr 15, 11:23 PM - Manika: Thanks to me üòÉ
Apr 15, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes yes
Apr 15, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently it was a math olympiad problem.
Apr 15, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And it's the math equivalent of the blue/white dress
Apr 15, 11:24 PM - Manika: It's too hard for for math Olympiad
Apr 15, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not even math!

Apr 20, 10:47 PM - Manika: But you won't be able to see
Apr 20, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even if you send, my system doesn't support :%
Apr 20, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/
Apr 20, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah
Apr 20, 10:47 PM - Manika: Racism
Apr 20, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why? It's natural
Apr 20, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You can argue that showing only fair people in emoji is racism
Apr 20, 10:48 PM - Manika: Dark guy n all
Apr 20, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Having the option to show the dark guy makes it normal
Apr 20, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So many ways to argue
Apr 20, 10:48 PM - Manika: Hmmm
Apr 20, 10:49 PM - Manika: They could have come up with better emojis.

Apr 20, 10:50 PM - Manika: You can send messages to mojo.
Apr 20, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mojo and I, we talk on the phone
Apr 20, 10:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No messages, no whatsapp, no Skype. We're old fashioned

Apr 20, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No sister also?
Apr 20, 10:54 PM - Manika: Nope.
Apr 20, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then why go anywhere else?
Apr 20, 10:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He should've just gone home.
Apr 20, 10:59 PM - Manika: Too many mosquitoes in my aunts house.
Apr 20, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Too many mosquitoes everywhere these days.
Apr 20, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In college also.
Apr 20, 11:00 PM - Manika: Except hostel.
Apr 20, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So prableen didn't tell you whether she invited him home or not? My interest is piqued :P
Apr 20, 11:01 PM - Manika: Noüòâ
Apr 20, 11:01 PM - Manika: He picked her up and dropped her back home.
Apr 20, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you think it was awkward?
Apr 20, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He'd be waiting to be invited upstairs.
Apr 20, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She didn't know if it was appropriate.
Apr 20, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then there's an awkward hug, and they leave?
Apr 20, 11:02 PM - Manika: Nah she's invites Akash to her house many times.
Apr 20, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then she walks away wondering whether she missed out on a golden opportunity.
Apr 20, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And he rides away wondering whether he should've been bolder.
Apr 20, 11:02 PM - Manika: Their hugs are not awkward.
Apr 20, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Imagine the situation Mans. I'm painting a picture.
Apr 20, 11:03 PM - Manika: Your some mind reader!!
Apr 20, 11:03 PM - Manika: You understand people so wellüòÇ
Apr 20, 11:03 PM - Manika: I am imagining it.
Apr 20, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
Apr 20, 11:03 PM - Manika: It seems all sad.
Apr 20, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then he feels his phone vibrate so he stops and checks.
Apr 20, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It says "The door's open."
Apr 20, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ~end of scene~
Apr 20, 11:06 PM - Manika: Where did you disappear ?
Apr 20, 11:07 PM - Manika: Doing something else?
Apr 20, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My net stopped working
Apr 20, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Turned data on
Apr 20, 11:09 PM - Manika: Why did you end it ?
Apr 20, 11:09 PM - Manika: Ohh
Apr 20, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: End what?
Apr 20, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The scene?
Apr 20, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's how books and movies are written.
Apr 20, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some stuff is left to the imagination.
Apr 20, 11:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's for you to figure out whether he went back and if something happened after that.
Apr 20, 11:12 PM - Manika: Ehhh
Apr 20, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sure there's a term for it. But I don't know how to look it up and find it.
Apr 20, 11:13 PM - Manika: He would have gone back noüòã
Apr 20, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He'd have gone back racing :P
Apr 20, 11:14 PM - Manika: Let's end the scene now.
Apr 20, 11:14 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're feeling uncomfortable? :P
Apr 20, 11:15 PM - Manika: I won't be able to look at Prableen and mojo in college.
Apr 20, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
Apr 20, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is her apartment accessible? Can people see you come and go?
Apr 20, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Security?
Apr 20, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Where's parking?
Apr 20, 11:17 PM - Manika: There's security but they don't care.
Apr 20, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Interesting.
Apr 20, 11:17 PM - Manika: Prableen and Akash hang out at her place most of the time.
Apr 20, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh.
Apr 20, 11:18 PM - Manika: I would never do that.
Apr 20, 11:18 PM - Manika: So scary.

Apr 20, 11:18 PM - Manika: Yess
Apr 20, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What about going over?
Apr 20, 11:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes there's no other way
Apr 20, 11:18 PM - Manika: That's okay.
Apr 20, 11:19 PM - Manika: As long as I don't get caught...it's fine.
Apr 20, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Adrenaline rush :P
Apr 20, 11:21 PM - Manika: You've got caught by your parents with a girl üòÇ

Apr 20, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I haven't really been caught doing anything
Apr 20, 11:22 PM - Manika: Ohh
Apr 20, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When I was in school my parents saw some messages and all.
Apr 20, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But there was nothing therrm
Apr 20, 11:23 PM - Manika: They knew that you had a girlfriend?
Apr 20, 11:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There were only 5-6 messages. But there wasn't anything much on them.
Apr 20, 11:24 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I talked my way out of it, but they took my phone away after a few days
Apr 20, 11:24 PM - Manika: Who was the girlüòú

Apr 22, 2:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll tell you how this works.
Apr 22, 2:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If there are no gaps, he can't put braces on. Which means that he needs to create gaps.
Apr 22, 2:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That happens by removing a tooth or two.
Apr 22, 2:07 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why one of cherry's teeth were removed.
Apr 22, 2:07 AM - Manika: I don't have gaps
Apr 22, 2:07 AM - Manika: And I can't let them remove any tooth
Apr 22, 2:07 AM - Manika: And braces look so ugly.

Apr 22, 2:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I think your teeth and fine, and your smile is really nice.

Apr 22, 2:09 AM - Manika: Most of them have told me that I need to get my teeth fixed
Apr 22, 2:09 AM - Manika: Yeah ?
Apr 22, 2:10 AM - Manika: Hmm...then il have to live with these teeth forever.
Apr 22, 2:10 AM - Manika: I won't get braces üëç
Apr 22, 2:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I used to be so worried about my teeth
Apr 22, 2:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Enquired about braces and all
Apr 22, 2:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I used to have gaps
Apr 22, 2:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Then they said two have to be removed
Apr 22, 2:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: So I said no thanks
Apr 22, 2:12 AM - Manika: Your teeth are in front also .

Apr 22, 2:15 AM - Manika: I havnt noticed anyone's lower teeth.
Apr 22, 2:15 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's a problem with my jaw.
Apr 22, 2:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Lower and upper ones don't align properly
Apr 22, 2:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Because of that there's a popping sound
Apr 22, 2:17 AM - Manika: The doctor told you about it  or is it something you've noticed.
Apr 22, 2:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes my jaw gets locked
Apr 22, 2:17 AM - Manika: Has it happened to you?
Apr 22, 2:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah
Apr 22, 2:17 AM - Manika: You won't be able to move your jaws at all?
Apr 22, 2:18 AM - Manika: When did it happen?
Apr 22, 2:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It happens sometimes with really hard food and all
Apr 22, 2:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know how it happened.

Goa is really hot at this time. Not worth it I think.
Apr 25, 9:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not a good time to travel during actually.

Apr 25, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Depends. Maybe the fit is not very uncomfortable.
Apr 25, 10:04 PM - Manika: I like skinny jeans.
Apr 25, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So do I
Apr 25, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't pull off regular jeans.
Apr 25, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It looks odd.
Apr 25, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm too thin m
Apr 25, 10:04 PM - Manika: Perfect for your skinny legs.
Apr 25, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My legs aren't skinny
Apr 25, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 25, 10:05 PM - Manika: I've seen your legs üòÅ
Apr 25, 10:05 PM - Manika: Okay not skinny

Apr 25, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòã
Apr 25, 10:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I couldn't have a beard then!
Apr 25, 10:14 PM - Manika: Imagine touching your face and its all smooth and soft without facial hair
Apr 25, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Does sound nice.
Apr 25, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I think I like being a guy.
Apr 25, 10:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: More freedom to do stuff.

Apr 25, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know. It's sad. But it'll change eventually.
Apr 25, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The thing I dislike is how girls sometimes take advantage, sometimes complain about the same things.
Apr 25, 10:18 PM - Manika: It's fine to take advantage once in a while
Apr 25, 10:18 PM - Manika: üòâ
Apr 25, 10:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, I would also take advantage
Apr 25, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Still, women need to be stronger
Apr 25, 10:19 PM - Manika: Yeah...emotionally they are weak.
Apr 25, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That can be fixed though. It's a result of the upbringing. Everything from the time you're born makes you who you are emotionally.
Apr 25, 10:25 PM - Manika: But some girls cry for everything.
Apr 25, 10:26 PM - Manika: Do you know that Sowmya girl.
Apr 25, 10:26 PM - Manika: If you tell her a sad story she'll start crying.
Apr 25, 10:27 PM - Manika: If someone else gets hurt also she starts crying.

Apr 25, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh
Apr 25, 10:30 PM - Manika: You met Sowmya on that TCS quiz day.
Apr 25, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I get confused between the two. This is the one with the hunch back no?
Apr 25, 10:34 PM - Manika: Yes.
Apr 25, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh

Apr 25, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Come over
Apr 25, 10:45 PM - Manika: Come pick me up.

Apr 26, 8:03 PM - Manika: You're almost done with it.
Apr 26, 8:03 PM - Manika: 3 more days and we'll be done with project work
Apr 26, 8:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòû
Apr 26, 8:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Heard any more about the supposed trip on 30th?

Apr 26, 8:38 PM - Manika: Now you look like drug addict
Apr 26, 8:38 PM - Manika: a
Apr 26, 8:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Unemployment does that to you üòì
Apr 26, 8:42 PM - Manika: How can a young entrepreneur look like that
Apr 26, 8:42 PM - Manika: New fashion statement
Apr 26, 8:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you no? I'm jobless. Therefore depressed. Therefore unkempt.
Apr 26, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But yes, new fashion statement.
Apr 26, 8:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm waiting for people to stop asking me to shave. Then suddenly I'll spring a surprise.
Apr 26, 8:49 PM - Manika: Okay il stop asking you to shave
Apr 26, 8:49 PM - Manika: It actually looks fine
Apr 26, 8:49 PM - Manika: Il text you in 2 mins
Apr 26, 8:49 PM - Manika: Don't sleep

Apr 26, 9:04 PM - Manika: I have to write about the concepts
Apr 26, 9:05 PM - Manika: It's such a pain typing out the formulas in word.
Apr 26, 9:05 PM - Manika: You'll be working in the report ?
Apr 26, 9:05 PM - Manika: On*
Apr 26, 9:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Latex is such a blessing.

Apr 26, 9:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why?
Apr 26, 9:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It wasn't nice?
Apr 26, 9:38 PM - Manika: I didn't want to eat cause I don't want to get pimples üòÅ
Apr 26, 9:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ohh
Apr 26, 9:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Pimples are so annoying
Apr 26, 9:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It doesn't even affect some people.
Apr 26, 9:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Remember when I used to have the fringe? That was sometimes just to cover the pimples I used to go.
Apr 26, 9:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *Get
Apr 26, 9:42 PM - Manika: I envy those people who don't get pimples at all
Apr 26, 9:42 PM - Manika: You grew your hair to cover up your pimples üòÇ
Apr 26, 9:43 PM - Manika: Fringe.
Apr 26, 9:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, my forehead had a crazy number of pimples!
Apr 26, 9:43 PM - Manika: Sometimes if your hair falls on your face also you get pimples.
Apr 26, 9:44 PM - Manika: I already have enough marks in my face...can't afford any more pimples.
Apr 26, 9:44 PM - Manika: Coming to college tomorrow ?
Apr 26, 9:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes
Apr 26, 9:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I have a lot of moles on my face
Apr 26, 9:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think more than 10
Apr 26, 9:45 PM - Manika: You have moles...but they are not prominent.
Apr 26, 9:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. No Ritu type mole.
Apr 26, 9:46 PM - Manika: Yeah and like JAnani also.
Apr 26, 9:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I have moles in some very interesting places :P
Apr 26, 9:47 PM - Manika: I have one mile on my lip
Apr 26, 9:47 PM - Manika: You must have moles all over your body
Apr 26, 9:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't remember that one
Apr 26, 9:47 PM - Manika: Mole*
Apr 26, 9:48 PM - Manika: It's very light....it suddenly appeared when I was in 5th std
Apr 26, 9:48 PM - Manika: Very weird.
Apr 26, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's always like that with moles
Apr 26, 9:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 26, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Out of nowhere, two on my palm
Apr 26, 9:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Looking for moles is like a treasure hunt
Apr 26, 9:50 PM - Manika: For you it must be very easy to spot
Apr 26, 9:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For you also.
Apr 26, 9:50 PM - Manika: Cause they are everywhere
Apr 26, 9:51 PM - Manika: I have very few moles.
Apr 26, 9:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought this was about my complexion üòù
Apr 26, 9:51 PM - Manika: I have one on my tongue.
Apr 26, 9:51 PM - Manika: Yeah your complexion also !
Apr 26, 9:52 PM - Manika: White boy.
Apr 26, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
Apr 26, 9:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Chocolate.
Apr 26, 9:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why Praby likes me. I'm the right shade.
Apr 26, 9:53 PM - Manika: Hahaha.
Apr 26, 9:53 PM - Manika: White chocolate
Apr 26, 9:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Dark chocolate!
Apr 26, 9:54 PM - Manika: She'll eat you up üòÄ
Apr 26, 9:54 PM - Manika: üòÇ
Apr 26, 9:54 PM - Manika: She likes dark chocolate also
Apr 26, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Beast mode.
Apr 26, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You make too much fun of mojo and prableen.
Apr 26, 9:54 PM - Manika: I wonder who the dark chocolate boy is
Apr 26, 9:55 PM - Manika: Yeah I knowüòå
Apr 26, 9:55 PM - Manika: It's like I can't stop at all
Apr 26, 9:55 PM - Manika: I feel guilty when I talk to her.
Apr 26, 9:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Imagine someone making fun of you with someone else right now.
Apr 26, 9:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hahaha!
Apr 26, 9:55 PM - Manika: Nooüôà
Apr 26, 9:56 PM - Manika: I don't think anyone would make fun of me
Apr 26, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not fun exactly, but talking.
Apr 26, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd make fun of you. It's too much entertainment.
Apr 26, 9:56 PM - Manika: Let's stop making fun of mojo and Prableen
Apr 26, 9:56 PM - Manika: Karma *
Apr 26, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh you know what happened?
Apr 26, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I found out how Hamsa got fat.
Apr 26, 9:57 PM - Manika: What happened ?
Apr 26, 9:57 PM - Manika: How?
Apr 26, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently she'd been in a terrible accident, broken bones, surgery and all that. So for a long time she couldn't move.
Apr 26, 9:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That was pretty sad.
Apr 26, 9:57 PM - Manika: Ohh that's sad.
Apr 26, 9:58 PM - Manika: Should tell aashish about it.
Apr 26, 9:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Because of Aashish we made fun of her
Apr 26, 9:58 PM - Manika: Ahhhüòî
Apr 26, 9:59 PM - Manika: I won't make fun of anyone from now on.
Apr 26, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its okay!
Apr 26, 10:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think, as long as you're not being malicious or hateful its okay. It's just for your amusement.
Apr 26, 10:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But stuff like HereSay and all sucks. Because you know it comes from the fact that someone hates someone else.
Apr 26, 10:01 PM - Manika: Yeah
Apr 26, 10:01 PM - Manika: I don't hate anyone.
Apr 26, 10:01 PM - Manika: So it's all good.
Apr 26, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yep.
Apr 26, 10:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You feel bad that college is ending?
Apr 26, 10:03 PM - Manika: Yeah I'm sad.
Apr 26, 10:03 PM - Manika: I liked hostel and college.
Apr 26, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm.
Apr 26, 10:04 PM - Manika: You won't miss anything about college ?
Apr 26, 10:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I need a change of scenario. I need to actually do something with my life. College is such a waste of time :-/ Doesn't let you achieve anything.
Apr 26, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hope not.
Apr 26, 10:05 PM - Manika: Ahh.
Apr 26, 10:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. Maybe I will enetually. But for now, I'm convincing myself that its good that it's over.
Apr 26, 10:07 PM - Manika: It's like 12th std all over again.
Apr 26, 10:07 PM - Manika: You'll eventually get adjusted to the new environment and new people.
Apr 26, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: At least in school there was a point. I don't know. I feel like BMS just sold us a lie.
Apr 26, 10:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like we didn't really learn anything. :(
Apr 26, 10:08 PM - Manika: That part is true
Apr 26, 10:09 PM - Manika: I havnt learnt anything new at all from the first day of college
Apr 26, 10:10 PM - Manika: 4 years I've been stagnant.
Apr 26, 10:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We've gone backwards in ability actually. Being idle for so long means you lose all the sharpness you once had.
Apr 26, 10:15 PM - Manika: Yeah...I'll have to actually study everything all over again to keep up with outside world.
Apr 26, 10:15 PM - Manika: That's my plan for June and July.
Apr 26, 10:15 PM - Manika: üòÖ
Apr 26, 10:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In chik?
Apr 26, 10:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
Apr 26, 10:28 PM - Manika: Skype ?
Apr 26, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My dad.
Apr 26, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We're almost the same.
Apr 26, 10:37 PM - Manika: Yeah you both look the same.
Apr 26, 10:38 PM - Manika: In the pic he looks like you.
Apr 26, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah
Apr 26, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He was calling me to dubai
Apr 26, 10:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it's too boring there.
Apr 26, 10:41 PM - Manika: You  can go there for a few days.
Apr 26, 10:41 PM - Manika: It'll be a nice trip.
Apr 26, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No point :/
Apr 26, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Visa and tickets will cost more than 30k.
Apr 26, 10:47 PM - Manika: Your mom is going nah.
Apr 26, 10:47 PM - Manika: You can go and come back.
Apr 26, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. I'll ask her to stay for a month.
Apr 26, 10:47 PM - Manika: Hahaha...home alone scenes
Apr 26, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Coming home? :P
Apr 26, 10:48 PM - Manika: Party at your place üéâ
Apr 26, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You'll be in chikmaglur
Apr 26, 10:49 PM - Manika: Last time I came to your place....I was kinda bored with weed.
Apr 26, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll have to call someone else.
Apr 26, 10:49 PM - Manika: I can come to Bangalore in the middle.
Apr 26, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, it didn't work üòû
Apr 26, 10:50 PM - Manika: Call someone else üòí
Apr 26, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòù
Apr 26, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'll call you, but you should come. 
You've been smoking no? This time weed might work
Apr 26, 10:54 PM - Manika: I havnt been smokingüò±
Apr 26, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
Apr 26, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Remember how you smoke two packs when you're stressed out? 
On average days two or three cigs?
Apr 26, 10:58 PM - Manika: That time I used to smoke cause of internals tension üòì
Apr 26, 10:58 PM - Manika: Il go for smoke now üö¨üö¨
Apr 26, 10:59 PM - Manika: A*
Apr 26, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Internals tension? IPR and PRM and all?
Apr 26, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I was so tense but I didn't know what to do.
Apr 26, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to smoke but I'm afraid it'll make me a bad person. üòì
Apr 26, 11:00 PM - Manika: Dude I don't smoke üòå
Apr 26, 11:01 PM - Manika: I have taken a few puffs that's it max.
Apr 26, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't get when I'm kidding üòë
Apr 26, 11:02 PM - Manika: I knew you were kidding.
Apr 26, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then?
Apr 26, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hate smoke you know? Makes me nauseous.
Apr 26, 11:03 PM - Manika: Ahh...I don't know.
Apr 26, 11:03 PM - Manika: I'm fine with the smoke.
Apr 26, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If it's that great, passive smoke should make you feel good too shouldn't it?
Apr 26, 11:04 PM - Manika: Sometimes it's very tempting to try.
Apr 26, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But passive smoke just makes you feel sick. So imagine what the cigarette actually does.
Apr 26, 11:04 PM - Manika: Yeah smoking kills
Apr 26, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Weed is mostly that
Apr 26, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's mostly tobacco, very little weed.
Apr 26, 11:05 PM - Manika: I won't do weed
Apr 26, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I did bong shots in Surathkal
Apr 26, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Got the trip. 
It's nice.
Apr 26, 11:05 PM - Manika: What is that?
Apr 26, 11:05 PM - Manika: You had too much fun in Surathkal
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know the hookah no?
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Manika: Yes.
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They have water and coal and all?
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Similar sort of setup.
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Manika: Yup
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The smoke passes through the water.
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Manika: Ohh.
Apr 26, 11:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's much stronger because a lot of smoke builds up.
Apr 26, 11:07 PM - Manika: Hookah gives me a headache...i think it's the paan flavour mostly c
Apr 26, 11:07 PM - Manika: Bong shots...should try it c
Apr 26, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've never tried hookah
Apr 26, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The most fun is mushrooms. Kodaikanal.
Apr 26, 11:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No effort involved. You can't not do it right.
Apr 26, 11:09 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Just chew and swallow.
Apr 26, 11:09 PM - Manika: Get it one day !
Apr 26, 11:09 PM - Manika: And then what happens ?
Apr 26, 11:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then depending on your mood you trip.
Apr 26, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you're happy you become excessively happy. If you're sad or paranoid that also becomes overwhelming.
Apr 26, 11:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes you hallucinate.
Apr 26, 11:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For me everything I was thinking became too vivid. It's like whatever I was thinking about, was actually happening at that moment.
Apr 26, 11:14 PM - Manika: It was like a dream
Apr 26, 11:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Strange it is. But it's nice.
Apr 26, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For a day when you have nothing better to do it's good. 
Kodaikanal, there's not much else to do. Just eat shrooms and sit around.
Apr 26, 11:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All these foreigners show up, stay for weeks at a time
Apr 26, 11:18 PM - Manika: Kodaikanal seems like some honeymoon destination.
Apr 26, 11:19 PM - Manika: I prefer beaches to hill stations
Apr 26, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It is actually.
Apr 26, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But then again, so is Munnar.
Apr 26, 11:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it looks like those're the places we're looking at for our post college trip :P
Apr 26, 11:21 PM - Manika: For now let's go somewhere at least.
Apr 26, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll go somewhere
Apr 26, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Coorg mostly.
Apr 26, 11:22 PM - Manika: I havnt been to Munnar
Apr 26, 11:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Stay is covered no? That helps.
Apr 26, 11:22 PM - Manika: Coorg  also is fine.
Apr 26, 11:22 PM - Manika: YeahüòÉ
Apr 26, 11:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Show me a fat picture :P
Apr 26, 11:28 PM - Manika: Il show you any funny picture but not my fat picture
Apr 26, 11:29 PM - Manika: I don't keep them on my phone also.
Apr 26, 11:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
Apr 26, 11:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Still doing report?
Apr 26, 11:43 PM - Manika: Almost done
Apr 26, 11:44 PM - Manika: I have to mail it to Aanchal
Apr 26, 11:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Apr 26, 11:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't seem to get the flow right
Apr 26, 11:50 PM - Manika: How many pages is it ?
Apr 26, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Right now around 25
Apr 26, 11:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: lots more to be added.
Apr 26, 11:50 PM - Manika: You're compiling it together?
Apr 26, 11:51 PM - Manika: Adi spoke to Harish and he wants at least 50-80 pages
Apr 26, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sort of. Mojo wrote something. But there's no progression. Have to work out what to put where.
Apr 26, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He spoke when?
Apr 26, 11:51 PM - Manika: Today
Apr 26, 11:51 PM - Manika: Adi was in college.
Apr 26, 11:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't understand how they can impose a page restriction. That's the stupidest thing I've heard.
Apr 26, 11:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh. I thought saw. Saw a sheetu post from Robotics Lab.
Apr 26, 11:52 PM - Manika: Someone knows all about sheetal nowüòÇ
Apr 26, 11:52 PM - Manika: They were doing the report.
Apr 26, 11:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh. You went and hung out?
Apr 26, 11:57 PM - Manika: No...We went to aishas house.
Apr 27, 12:00 AM - Manika: Till what time will you work?
Apr 27, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Tonight?
Apr 27, 12:00 AM - Manika: Yes.
Apr 27, 12:00 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Till I'm satisfied with the work, or till I fall asleep on the spot
Apr 27, 12:01 AM - Manika: And that's not any time soon ?
Apr 27, 12:01 AM - Manika: Fall asleep on your laptop
Apr 27, 12:01 AM - Manika: ?
Apr 27, 12:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No no, I'll stay up and work
Apr 27, 12:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Can't let my team down.
Apr 27, 12:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: :P
Apr 27, 12:02 AM - Manika: You are the only hope !
Apr 27, 12:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I wish I could be like cherry. Doesn't give a damn about anything. Must be snoring right now :P
Apr 27, 12:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Dreaming about Chinnu
Apr 27, 12:02 AM - Manika: You should have given her some work.

May 7, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know the evolution of both Christianity and Muslim faith happened together?
May 7, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They have the same common starting point.
May 7, 10:43 PM - Manika: Yeah I know.
May 7, 10:43 PM - Manika: Old Testament is the same as Quran no
May 7, 10:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yet they couldn't be more different.
May 7, 10:44 PM - Manika: But do you all also have these restrictions
May 7, 10:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what the quran has at all actually.
May 7, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even we have restrictions that I don't really care about. Religion is the one thing that I don't allow to dictate to me. I don't feel like it's fair.
May 7, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I pray and spend so much time in the church okay?
May 7, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I have nothing against it. But I don't understand scripture and the rules.
May 7, 10:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: All they do is read stuff that was written so long ago, sometimes very biased stuff, and interpret it they way they like it
May 7, 10:47 PM - Manika: It's your wish you should do what you think is right.
May 7, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah.
May 7, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can't understand why people get so offended though
May 7, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: When someone talks about other religions.
May 7, 10:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Surely there are people doing worse things in the world.
May 7, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The most harmless stuff is what upsets people the most. It's retarded!
May 7, 10:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: For those sort of things I dislike religion and religious practices. 
It makes people so irrational.
May 7, 10:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>

May 8, 12:06 AM - Manika: I didn't expect that you'd ask me out.
May 8, 12:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Honestly, it was only half a joke.
May 8, 12:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't know whether I wanted to ask you out or not, but I knew I liked tou

May 10, 1:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Good night Manika! ‚ô•
May 10, 4:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm up but too groggy. Can't study like this. I'll be up at 7 üòä
May 10, 6:49 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Morning you! I hope you're up?
May 10, 7:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I dreamt about you!
May 10, 7:12 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We were together somewhere, you saw Rituparna and went and hugged her. üòä
May 10, 7:12 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't remember anything else. No soldiers or hospital signs. üòî But soon I hope.
May 10, 7:23 AM - Manika: Any dream with the soldiers would be a nice dream üòÅ
May 10, 7:23 AM - Manika: Without*
May 10, 7:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Why without? üòî
May 10, 7:34 AM - Manika: Yes don't dream about them also.
May 10, 7:52 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to be friends with them. üòî
May 10, 9:17 AM - Manika: Make friends with IPR for today.
May 10, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: üòÇ
May 10, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mass was nice today.
May 10, 9:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: This priest came, he was telling us about some new theology and ideas of the church.
May 10, 9:18 AM - Manika: Nice üòá
May 10, 9:18 AM - Manika: You liked the ideas ?
May 10, 9:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It was about relationships, sexuality and God.
May 10, 9:19 AM - Manika: No wonder you liked itüòÇüòÇüòÇ
May 10, 9:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't expect them to understand and relate to how people are, but the thinking in church is about how you find God through relationships and not just on your own.
May 10, 9:20 AM - Manika: What a way to start your day.
May 10, 9:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And about how those things are natural and good and should not be frowned upon.
May 10, 9:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I like that the church is being open and progressive.
May 10, 9:21 AM - Manika: Nice
May 10, 9:21 AM - Manika: Ohh so all of this makes sense to you now.
May 10, 9:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And I also realised that for far too long I've been really worried and anxious. But the past few weeks have been awesome. I'm so happy these days! I wonder why üòã
May 10, 9:23 AM - Manika: I like the girl whose making you happy. üôà
May 10, 9:23 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you no? What didn't make sense to me is the way they took stuff from the Bible out of context and made rules about how you're supposed to be. The Bible I can't relate to. But these things are proposals by the previous Pope.
May 10, 9:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Remember John Paul I I ?
May 10, 9:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He's going to be declared a saint in some time.
May 10, 9:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: And he's obviously a modern man.
May 10, 9:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Some girl/girls üòù
May 10, 9:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The new Pope is actually even better. Extremely progressive! He brings the church to you, and not the other way around.
May 10, 9:26 AM - Manika: Good that you're liking your church üëç
May 10, 9:27 AM - Manika: You make me happy tooüòò
May 10, 9:27 AM - Manika: I have to Xerox the notes
May 10, 9:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Borrow and finish off no?
May 10, 9:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I like being happy. It's been far too long! üòò
May 10, 9:31 AM - Manika: No I'm xeroxing it now.
May 10, 9:32 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh, one girl invited me to Hyderabad :P
May 10, 9:32 AM - Manika: Whooaa
May 10, 9:32 AM - Manika: Everyone wants to invite you
May 10, 9:32 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You won't invite me to chik :P
May 10, 9:33 AM - Manika: I've already invited you üòÅ

May 10, 9:35 AM - Manika: It would have been sad üòè
May 10, 9:35 AM - Sonal Saldanha: She's sort of fat :P
May 10, 9:35 AM - Manika: Then you could have moved in with her üòÇ

May 10, 9:37 AM - Manika: Stay away from her üòî
May 10, 9:37 AM - Manika: üò•
May 10, 9:37 AM - Manika: Hmmm
May 10, 9:37 AM - Manika: Ohhh that one .

May 11, 5:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only two school friends have seen where I live :P
May 11, 5:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Only a handful know I have a brother.

May 11, 5:49 PM - Manika: Takes time.
May 11, 5:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's it about?
May 11, 5:50 PM - Manika: Sometimes I don't think and sometimes it's just some random thoughts.
May 11, 5:50 PM - Manika: You tell what ever is on my mind?

May 11, 5:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Trolling¬†is an Internet slang term used to describe any Internet user behavior that is meant to intentionally anger or frustrate someone else, though not to be confused with¬†cyberbullying, a form of online harassment carried out against an individual in a deliberately hostile manner, often without any reason, or¬†pranking, which similarly involves playing jokes on strangers for one‚Äôs amusement, but typically implies more coordination and intent.
May 11, 5:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now tell me who trolled who. :P
May 11, 5:53 PM - Manika: Okay now you are right

May 17, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No no, proper lipstick.
May 17, 2:19 PM - Manika: You must be getting ideas.
May 17, 2:19 PM - Manika: I don't use lipstick :(
May 17, 2:20 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Never tried?
May 17, 2:20 PM - Manika: üíã

May 17, 2:25 PM - Manika: You?
May 17, 2:25 PM - Manika: Couldn't think of anything.
May 17, 2:25 PM - Manika: Maybe clothes.
May 17, 2:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I meant in people Mans
May 17, 2:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But in general, I like new stuff.
May 17, 2:26 PM - Manika: ?
May 17, 2:27 PM - Manika: People??
May 17, 2:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like the presentation we saw yesterday :P
May 17, 2:29 PM - Manika: Give me an example üòÖ
May 17, 2:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like feet, we were discussing last night
May 17, 2:31 PM - Manika: I notice anyone that closely
May 17, 2:31 PM - Manika: Don't *
May 17, 2:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Nothing fascinates you?
May 17, 2:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think I like eyes
May 17, 2:32 PM - Manika: I like eyes
May 17, 2:33 PM - Manika: I'm lost in this conversation.
May 17, 2:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay lets talk about something else :P
May 17, 2:33 PM - Manika: I don't know what fascinates me
May 17, 2:33 PM - Manika: Lol
May 17, 2:34 PM - Manika: Okay üòÄ
May 17, 2:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You should no? That's the point of life :)
May 17, 2:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You should know what you like and what you dislike
May 17, 2:35 PM - Manika: Yeah I know...I'll find out eventually
May 17, 2:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think thats why I'm so fussy. Coz I'm very particular about what I like and what I dislike
May 17, 2:35 PM - Manika: I usually adjust...I should change
May 17, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Should adjust also. I used to be unwilling to compromise before okay?
May 17, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But with people that just does not work :/
May 17, 2:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It was more trouble than its worth. So I started to accept and adjust.
May 17, 2:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Like talking in kannada, going by bus, expecting too much of people.
May 17, 2:38 PM - Manika: I like the way you are...you know what you want .
May 17, 2:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Little things, but I used to get too worked up. Remember I told you? I'm so much better now. Before I used to make that irritated face all the time!
May 17, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And I used to just go away, like prableen does sometimes :P
May 17, 2:38 PM - Manika: I get so confused and In the end I get stressed out whenever I have to choose between anything.
May 17, 2:39 PM - Manika: Adjusting a little bit is fine.
May 17, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We're coming from two ends of the spectrum no?
May 17, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This is so cool :)
May 17, 2:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòò
May 17, 2:39 PM - Manika: See we are so opposite.
May 17, 2:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you know what to say when people ask "What's your type?"?
May 17, 2:41 PM - Manika: Lol no
May 17, 2:41 PM - Manika: Someone not like me
May 17, 2:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you think everyone has a type?
May 17, 2:42 PM - Manika: You must have thought of it  .
May 17, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I have. You know Freud no?
May 17, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The psychologist?
May 17, 2:43 PM - Manika: We can't get along with everyone no
May 17, 2:43 PM - Manika: No
May 17, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You remember that story we had?
May 17, 2:43 PM - Manika: What is your type then
May 17, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ISC?
May 17, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Id, ego, superego?
May 17, 2:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's Freud's proposal
May 17, 2:44 PM - Manika: Short story?
May 17, 2:44 PM - Manika: We didn't have it
May 17, 2:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One of those stories. The answer to questions about that story was about this stuff
May 17, 2:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But that's not relevant right now. I'm just going off topic :P
May 17, 2:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So Freud said that girls look for their dad, and guys look for their mom in a relationship
May 17, 2:46 PM - Manika: Ohhh
May 17, 2:46 PM - Manika: Ohhh
May 17, 2:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I don't think that's true. Not for me at least. My mom is anxious, worried and nags all the time :-/
May 17, 2:47 PM - Manika: Do you agree?
May 17, 2:48 PM - Manika: Hahaha...you need someone who nags all the time.
May 17, 2:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's also not very sophisticated. As in, she's just happy being simple, the way she's always been
May 17, 2:49 PM - Manika: So Freud is wrong
May 17, 2:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I like someone I can talk to. About everything that goes on in my mind. Someone who is genuinely interested and willing to contribute
May 17, 2:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Some say he's wrong, some say he's right. I think it depends on the sort of bond while growing up.
May 17, 2:50 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you think?
May 17, 2:51 PM - Manika: I don't agree
May 17, 2:52 PM - Manika: I'd like my life to be more exciting.
May 17, 2:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: More exciting?
May 17, 2:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: In what ways?
May 17, 2:56 PM - Manika: It should not be monotonous.
May 17, 2:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's exciting with me?
May 17, 2:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Is it too mentally taxing to talk to me? :P
May 17, 2:57 PM - Manika: Should go more on vacations and have fun
May 17, 2:57 PM - Manika: Prableen had called.
May 17, 2:57 PM - Manika: I have to do some project work now.
May 17, 2:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Didn't say no? :P
May 17, 2:57 PM - Manika: It's fun with you.
May 17, 2:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I hope you ate lunch!
May 17, 2:58 PM - Manika: I've always told you that.
May 17, 2:58 PM - Manika: Eating now.
May 17, 2:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's fun with you coz you're so open with me and I can be myself with you.
May 17, 2:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :*
May 17, 2:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you ever get bored with what I'm saying, you have to tell me okay?
May 17, 2:59 PM - Manika: I tell you almost everything.
May 17, 3:00 PM - Manika: But there are some stuff I don't tell anyone and I like it that way.
May 17, 3:00 PM - Manika: I can never get bored of you üòò
May 17, 3:00 PM - Manika: You can get bored of me
May 17, 3:00 PM - Manika: üëç
May 17, 3:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't tell me some stuff üò±
May 17, 3:01 PM - Manika: Yes üòÇ
May 17, 3:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I can't get bored of you. That's only when I don't really like or care for someone.
May 17, 3:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's this stuff about? Give me a hint :P
May 17, 3:02 PM - Manika: Hahaha can't tell you üòú
May 17, 3:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now I'm desperate to know :P
May 17, 3:02 PM - Manika: Il tell you when I feel like.
May 17, 3:02 PM - Manika: Lol it's nothing about you.
May 17, 3:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its okay, I was just kidding :)
May 17, 3:03 PM - Manika: Desperate üòÇ
May 17, 3:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You only have to do what you're comfortable with
May 17, 3:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes, do what you're uncomfortable with, to become comfortable with it.
May 17, 3:03 PM - Manika: That means I have to do everything.
May 17, 3:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But its for you to decide
May 17, 3:04 PM - Manika: You're comfortable with everything ?
May 17, 3:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I give you too much to think about?
May 17, 3:04 PM - Manika: Yeah...mental exercise.
May 17, 3:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I like to think that I am okay? But I'm quite emotional
May 17, 3:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So that gets in the way a lot.
May 17, 3:05 PM - Manika: Is that very often
May 17, 3:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Emotional?
May 17, 3:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No
May 17, 3:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Very very few people have seen it
May 17, 3:05 PM - Manika: But you're always smiling and laughing when you're in college
May 17, 3:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: My parents also don't really get to see it
May 17, 3:06 PM - Manika: Hmmm.
May 17, 3:06 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've built walls :P
May 17, 3:06 PM - Manika: I'm not allowed ??
May 17, 3:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't want to see me emotional
May 17, 3:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its not nice.
May 17, 3:07 PM - Manika: It's fine.
May 17, 3:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm irrational and stupid when I'm emotional.
May 17, 3:07 PM - Manika: But I don't want you to me sad.
May 17, 3:07 PM - Manika: Be*
May 17, 3:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And when I say emotional I mean sad and sort of depressed. I don't let myself be that way.
May 17, 3:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Right now I'm very happy though :*
May 17, 3:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Manika. ‚ù§
May 17, 3:09 PM - Manika: Don't ever be sad...do whatever makes you happy.
May 17, 3:09 PM - Manika: üòò

May 17, 3:10 PM - Manika: What happened?
May 17, 3:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then he pushes my hand, and scrolls down okay?
May 17, 3:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So Mojo and I were wondering what's going on and we asked him
May 17, 3:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He says he meant scroll down, but didn't want to say it coz we'll make fun of him üòÇ
May 17, 3:11 PM - Manika: What's wrong in saying scroll down
May 17, 3:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He wanted to say go down

May 17, 3:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I get the feeling that you don't like this conversation :P
May 17, 3:16 PM - Manika: Dirty jokes
May 17, 3:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Better than mojo's jokes
May 17, 3:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I really don't like his jokes.
May 17, 3:16 PM - Manika: I couldn't understand why you were laughing.
May 17, 3:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "Sick you are!"
May 17, 3:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: "Bitch"
May 17, 3:17 PM - Manika: You don't think too much.

May 20, 11:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't trust quality online.
May 20, 11:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The return and replace process is really cumbersome.
May 20, 11:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: At least in stores, you look at it, wear and see if it's nice, then walk away with the product.
May 20, 11:58 AM - Manika: The brands Will be the same so the quality wont matter.
May 20, 11:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It does actually. She bought Puma, one was smaller than the other. So uncomfortable.

May 20, 12:02 PM - Manika: I like your other Nike shoes also.
May 20, 12:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I'm very selective about what I buy. If I have some product from the same company before, then I buy coz I know it fits well.
May 20, 12:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Otherwise I avoid.
May 20, 12:03 PM - Manika: I like the way you dress.
May 20, 12:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So risky. I spend 2k and all per piece of clothing, such a waste if you have to return.

May 20, 12:05 PM - Manika: I think I was better dressed.
May 20, 12:05 PM - Manika: I was selective.
May 20, 12:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know, very few people can pull off jeans and tops.

May 20, 12:06 PM - Manika: Me??

May 23, 10:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: We'll have a tough time finding places that we can go to.
May 23, 10:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought Pondi would be nice.

May 23, 10:28 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It was sweet
May 23, 10:28 PM - Manika: Once upon a time in BMSCE there was this angry young handsome boy  and a young sweet girl.
May 23, 10:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They were both young?
May 23, 10:30 PM - Manika: They never bothered to acknowledge each other for years and she walked past the boy  not knowing that one day she would end up with him.
May 23, 10:30 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Why didn't they acknowledge each other?
May 23, 10:30 PM - Manika: The girl was definitely young.
May 23, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The guy might have been a ghost do you think? Many many years old?
May 23, 10:31 PM - Manika: Because they were blinded by their ego üòú
May 23, 10:31 PM - Manika: No ghosts at night !!
May 23, 10:31 PM - Manika: You spoilt the story.

May 23, 10:36 PM - Manika: As in ??
May 23, 10:37 PM - Manika: You think I simply saying that to you ?
May 23, 10:37 PM - Manika: It's a big deal ?
May 23, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: As in, for me to say that to anyone is a big deal
May 23, 10:38 PM - Manika: I shouldn't have said it?
May 23, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't mean it like that
May 23, 10:39 PM - Manika: I told you what I felt like.
May 23, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its about me, not you Mans.
May 23, 10:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its a big deal for me to say that to someone
May 23, 10:40 PM - Manika: Okay .
May 23, 10:40 PM - Manika: ‚ô•Ô∏è
May 23, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But I want to say that toyou so I said it
May 23, 10:43 PM - Manika: Hmm
May 23, 10:43 PM - Manika: Sonalüê∑
May 23, 10:44 PM - Manika: Where are you?
May 23, 10:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Talking to my dad about the trip
May 23, 10:45 PM - Manika: Oh then you text me later.
May 23, 10:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm Back :D
May 23, 10:55 PM - Manika: What did he say ?
May 23, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He just likes messing with me
May 23, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And its not even funny
May 23, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Not like how I do it
May 23, 10:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He said "college is over, what is the trip for now?"
May 23, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then I told him its because college is over
May 23, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then he asked me who does that
May 23, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So I said everyone
May 23, 10:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then he said Hmm
May 23, 10:56 PM - Manika: Even I feel I'm going to have the same conversation with my parents üòÇ
May 23, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Then he asked me where so I said I don't know, maybe Pondi.
May 23, 10:57 PM - Manika: Then did he agree ?
May 23, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He got a call so he had to go. But it should be okay. But the problem is my grandma and brother will be left here by themselves.
May 23, 10:57 PM - Sonal Saldanha: They'll be worried coz of that.
May 23, 10:58 PM - Manika: Oh yeah üòî
May 23, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: She's old and he's young so they worry
May 23, 10:58 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it shouldn't be a problem I feel.
May 23, 10:58 PM - Manika: And you're in between .
May 23, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Funny thing is, at the same age as him I would've handled the same or equivalent responsibilites
May 23, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But they'll be afraid to trust him with those when he grows to be that old
May 23, 10:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Its strange
May 23, 11:00 PM - Manika: You are the elder brother,you'll be more responsible.
May 23, 11:00 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe, but you get what I'm saying no? He's too young to do the same things I was doing at his age
May 23, 11:00 PM - Manika: It will be fun if this trip actually happens
May 23, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If I was him, I'd be really frustrated
May 23, 11:01 PM - Manika: Ohk
May 23, 11:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If I get to spend the whole time with you and no one interferes it'll be fun. Otherwise I'll get cranky :P
May 23, 11:02 PM - Manika: I'll make sure that you never get cranky üòÉ
May 23, 11:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòòüòò
May 23, 11:03 PM - Manika: For two to three day I think your brother will be able to manage.
May 23, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Lets live for us and not for others :)
May 23, 11:03 PM - Manika: Will he have holidays ?
May 23, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, he will. I know he can manage, but my parents don't trust him. I'll talk to them.
May 23, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: He has holidays too.
May 23, 11:04 PM - Manika: Should I tell that boys are also coming for this trip?
May 23, 11:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's two ways of looking at this. Either they feel its safer that boys are coming, or they feel that it's unsafe because boys are coming
May 23, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know what your parents will think like
May 23, 11:05 PM - Manika: If I say it's only girls then they'll have the issue with the safety and all
May 23, 11:05 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Exactly
May 23, 11:06 PM - Manika: Il tell them that the guys are also coming and that they are all my friends.
May 23, 11:06 PM - Manika: They might be happy that  I'm telling them the truth üòÉ
May 23, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: haha! Bad girl.

May 25, 7:42 AM - Manika: üôà
May 25, 7:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: *facepalm*
May 25, 7:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If you'd actually said admiring it'd be a good joke :P
May 25, 7:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But now the joke is on you Nicole üòÇ

May 25, 8:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But with you it feels necessary!
May 25, 8:02 AM - Manika: So funny no
May 25, 8:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've always been like that about everything because I care too much about privacy. I'm not even sure why.
May 25, 8:03 AM - Manika: That's who you are.
May 25, 8:04 AM - Manika: I used to get irritated at times when people show me too much affection.
May 25, 8:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Do you believe the star sign profiling and things like that?
May 25, 8:04 AM - Manika: Zodiac sign ?

May 25, 8:10 AM - Manika: Look at me üòÄ
May 25, 8:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: However, love for them is special. It is a lot about stability and commitment, so from an early age, marriage is on the Goats‚Äô minds. Loyal and caring towards their loved ones, the Capricorn individuals, though, will even pass up love for duty and virtue.
May 25, 8:11 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Patience, achievement, practicality and security net are their buzzwords. They may even act selfishly, if they don‚Äôt get what they want.
May 25, 8:12 AM - Manika: Aghhh
May 25, 8:12 AM - Sonal Saldanha: When the Capricorn women are in a romantic relationship, they do not let their partners dictate terms, though they will support them through ups and downs. They crave for companionship, but it would be better if they had some power, success, glamour and money
May 25, 8:12 AM - Manika: I don't think of marriage at all .
May 25, 8:12 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It can't all be accurate :)
May 25, 8:13 AM - Manika: I need success and money üòÉ
May 25, 8:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I need money! üòÅ
May 25, 8:13 AM - Manika: Obviously it's not all true but it's fun to read.
May 25, 8:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, its interesting sometimes.
May 25, 8:13 AM - Manika: I don't need babies,friends but I want Money
May 25, 8:13 AM - Manika: üòÉ
May 25, 8:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But when people give it too much importance it becomes irriratting
May 25, 8:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Obviously I'm not going to tell that girl my plans for marriage and parenthood :P
May 25, 8:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I needed to change the topic :P
May 25, 8:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Jokes are the best way of doing that!

May 25, 8:17 AM - Manika: I'd never be completely happy if I don't have my own money .
May 25, 8:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what I've thought about.
May 25, 8:18 AM - Manika: It's good that you've thought of all this.

May 25, 7:17 PM - Manika: I love that girl tooüòç
May 25, 7:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: BTW, I really do not like how Ayesha treats you. You've always been good to her so she can't tag you in pictures like that and ignore you and so on. On top of that she uses you when she's in college and so on. 

You should also just ignore her.
May 25, 7:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: https://instagram.com/p/3GuhkpS7zt/
May 25, 7:23 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòè
May 25, 7:23 PM - Manika: I know she's being cold to me but college is anyways getting over.I don't want to create a scene now and I havnt been that nice also to her. So it's okay.
May 25, 7:24 PM - Manika: Can we go to that place üòò
May 25, 7:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You've been nicer to her than most. You also told me that when she's in college you sometimes choose to be with her than with me because you feel guilty about her. Despite that she's so openly attacking you. 

I get very protective when someone does shit like this. No one should mess with you and get away with it.
May 25, 7:25 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm always willing! Let's go there and make out üòò
May 25, 7:26 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know my favourite part about today? When you kissed me on the neck. Goosebumps. ‚ò∫
May 25, 7:26 PM - Manika: I have kinda chosen her over you at times even though I really wanted to be with you.
May 25, 7:27 PM - Manika: I won't let anyone do that to me again.
May 25, 7:27 PM - Manika: üòò
May 25, 7:27 PM - Manika: It's so nice that you care about me ‚ô•Ô∏è

May 25, 7:31 PM - Manika: The hug is always my favourite.....I feel so warm and nice in your arms.
May 25, 7:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So sweetly you kissed me also ‚ò∫
May 25, 7:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I've never done that before okay? Hugs like that out in the open, but I don't care who's looking anymore. It feels amazing and I can't leave with without hugging you.
May 25, 7:33 PM - Manika: I feel so satisfied after hugging you..addicted to your hugs

May 25, 7:46 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd take you out and then I'd take you home every day.
May 25, 7:56 PM - Manika: Sonal it would have been so nice if we had more freedom.
May 25, 7:57 PM - Manika: I was talking to my mom now....she seemed so irritated that I was going out with friends everyday.
May 25, 7:57 PM - Manika: I am so scared to ask her permission for the trip.

It's going to be a very significant and difficult change. That's why you feel like going out with those friends as often as you can so you have some memories and good times to look back upon.
May 25, 9:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Emotional sob story :P

May 27, 9:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, Sonika is nice.

May 27, 9:53 PM - Manika: Weed night
May 27, 9:53 PM - Manika: M&S
May 27, 9:53 PM - Manika: Like marks and spencer
May 27, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Marks and Spencer
May 27, 9:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I was just going to say it!
May 27, 9:54 PM - Manika: Yes got it right üòòüòò
May 27, 9:54 PM - Manika: I wish we were alone on your terrace. üòÉ
May 27, 9:54 PM - Manika: üòú
May 27, 9:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But it's not as catchy as S&M.
May 27, 9:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I wish we were too. I'd do bad things with you.
May 27, 9:56 PM - Manika: S&M
May 27, 9:56 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now there's proper cover. Trees on the front.

May 27, 11:02 PM - Manika: What you doing?
May 27, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
May 27, 11:03 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Now off to my room be with my sweetie pie.

May 27, 11:04 PM - Manika: Sonal ‚ô•Ô∏è

May 27, 11:07 PM - Manika: Even I am sleepy.
May 27, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: ‚ò∫
May 27, 11:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I did a core workout today. Abs and back.
May 27, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Fell asleep Mans 23
May 27, 11:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: *?
May 27, 11:19 PM - Manika: Call
May 28, 12:00 AM - Manika: Bye
May 28, 12:00 AM - Manika: Come here !
May 28, 6:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Good morning Cutie üòò
May 28, 7:13 AM - Manika: üòÉ
May 28, 8:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm looking at the mysore coronation.
May 28, 8:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If we lived in a monarchy I'd be one of those anarchists trying to tear the system down. So annoying.
May 28, 8:56 AM - Manika: I would have enjoyed the power
May 28, 8:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But it sucks no? You're extremely unqualified but you still have riches beyond imagination.
May 28, 8:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: All you did was be born. And even that was not your choice. If
May 28, 9:04 AM - Manika: Like Rahul Gandhi
May 28, 9:05 AM - Manika: When you're born with  such riches and power you'll learn from a young age to manage it nah.
May 28, 9:12 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The point is, you didn't earn it. Which I think is a big deal when there's so much at stake. It's the same with corporate organizations too. That's why now they have a board of directors and they hire from outside. Because inheritance does not ever work.
May 28, 9:15 AM - Manika: Yeah I agree with you also.
May 28, 9:16 AM - Manika: If you are really good at your work you will get recognised anywhere.
May 28, 9:16 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a difficult choice. You want your family to do well, your kids to be well provided for. But in some cases you have to think beyond those things.
May 28, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's like how Tata works. Or Microsoft Works.
May 28, 9:17 AM - Manika: But some of these kids have been able to manage the companies.
May 28, 9:17 AM - Manika: I think they have been Trained like that from a young age about business and all
May 28, 9:18 AM - Manika: No?
May 28, 9:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: My dad has warned me. He said I'm not getting an inheritance :P
May 28, 9:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: He said I'm only going to be given an education
May 28, 9:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: They should be trained, but sometimes they're just not good enough. Look at GoT. üòù Is every kid able to succeed and have the same effect as the parent?
May 28, 9:19 AM - Manika: Nice example üëç
May 28, 9:21 AM - Manika: I've been told what il get and that it will be over in a year if I use all that and after that my parents won't be able to support me.
That's why so much emphasis on education.
May 28, 9:21 AM - Manika: It's nice earning and doing well
May 28, 9:23 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah? Over in a year?
May 28, 9:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: My parents don't have anything to give also actually. And I don't even want. My ambition is at a different scale all together.
May 28, 9:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I looked into it, and the number I sent on the group, they provide three rooms with attached bathrooms and a common area. 500 per head per day. It'd perfect for us.
May 28, 9:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: <Media omitted>
May 28, 9:32 AM - Manika: SonalüòÇüòÇüòÇ
May 28, 9:32 AM - Manika: What's its significance ?
May 28, 9:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know.
May 28, 9:33 AM - Manika: Too much.
May 28, 9:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Maybe there's no significance.
May 28, 9:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Or maybe I can't tell you coz then I'll blush.
May 28, 9:35 AM - Manika: I want you to blush üòäüòä
May 28, 9:35 AM - Sonal Saldanha: ‚ò∫
May 28, 9:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Muah!
May 28, 9:36 AM - Manika: Hahaha
May 28, 9:36 AM - Manika: üòò
May 28, 9:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What's your day looking like today?
May 28, 9:39 AM - Manika: I thought il fill the visa form
May 28, 9:39 AM - Manika: What do you want to do ?
May 28, 9:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. No plans as of now.
May 28, 9:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But visa is important. Get it out of the way üòä
May 28, 9:40 AM - Manika: Yeah il complete  the form.
May 28, 9:40 AM - Manika: You feel like doing something today ?
May 28, 9:40 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I feel like doing something everyday, but that's just me
May 28, 9:41 AM - Manika: But that's just you...so sad.
May 28, 9:41 AM - Manika: ‚ô•Ô∏è
May 28, 9:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: üòò
May 28, 9:41 AM - Manika: Tell me what you want to do ?
May 28, 9:41 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want you to finish off visa work quickly. Because dates will be difficult :/
May 28, 9:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Then we'll think about us.
May 28, 9:42 AM - Manika: Okay
May 28, 9:42 AM - Manika: Il complete the form today.
May 28, 9:42 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Call me when you're bored üòä
May 28, 9:42 AM - Manika: I'll call you.
May 28, 9:43 AM - Manika: Later when no one is there.
May 28, 9:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay üòò
May 28, 9:43 AM - Manika: Busy now ?
May 28, 9:43 AM - Manika: To text ?
May 28, 9:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No Mans.
May 28, 9:43 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm just walking around the house.
May 28, 9:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mom should call any minute now.
May 28, 9:44 AM - Sonal Saldanha: She cried a little when she left. It was so sad!
May 28, 9:44 AM - Manika: I was sleep talking to you last night .
May 28, 9:44 AM - Manika: Ohh that's so sad.
May 28, 9:44 AM - Manika: She must be missing you'll a lot üòï
May 28, 9:45 AM - Manika: You cried ?
May 28, 9:45 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I was sleep talking üòû
May 28, 9:45 AM - Manika: Yeah I know.
May 28, 9:45 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I was consoling her.
May 28, 9:45 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't cry. She cries when my dad leaves also.
May 28, 9:45 AM - Manika: Awww
May 28, 9:45 AM - Manika: You're such a goo son.
May 28, 9:46 AM - Manika: Good*
May 28, 9:46 AM - Sonal Saldanha: She's like that.. She should be stronger
May 28, 9:46 AM - Manika: It's fine.
May 28, 9:46 AM - Manika: You can show your emotions at times
May 28, 9:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Not like that, she worries all the time. I told you no?
May 28, 9:47 AM - Manika: Yup
May 28, 9:47 AM - Sonal Saldanha: When I'm out after dark and all.
May 28, 9:47 AM - Manika: Natural no to worry.
May 28, 9:48 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah, but when kids grow up it should ease.
May 28, 9:48 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's hard, to choose sides.
May 28, 9:48 AM - Sonal Saldanha: On one hand I worry about not upsetting them, on the other, what I want is totally different.
May 28, 9:50 AM - Manika: Do what you want to do üòÄ
May 28, 9:52 AM - Manika: I was thinking this morning and I am still scared about doing it with you Sonal.i don't want to be worried and l don't want any complications.
May 28, 9:52 AM - Manika: Can we wait till I'm a little sure if it.
May 28, 9:53 AM - Manika: I love you a lot and I want it to be with you.
May 28, 9:53 AM - Manika: But now immediately
May 28, 9:53 AM - Manika: Not*
May 28, 9:54 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want you to be worried either. I want it to be good and memorable.
May 28, 9:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: So we'll wait till you're okay. üòò
May 28, 9:56 AM - Manika: You're not upset ?
May 28, 9:56 AM - Manika: What's on your mind now?
May 28, 9:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No I'm not upset. I'm happy enough knowing you feel that way about me. 
I just hope we don't over think it. Because that can sometimes undo everything.
May 28, 9:57 AM - Manika: Over think it ?
May 28, 9:57 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Be overly paranoid I mean.
May 28, 9:58 AM - Manika: Hmmm yeah I know.
May 28, 9:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm never going to force you. That's not me. So you have nothing to be worried about. üòò
May 28, 9:59 AM - Manika: I'm know you will never force me into anything .
May 28, 9:59 AM - Manika: I*

May 28, 10:00 AM - Manika: I did about this.
May 28, 10:00 AM - Manika: It's good or bad ?
May 28, 10:00 AM - Manika: Thinking so much.
May 28, 10:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Being careful is very important. Because neither of us has been there before it's difficult to be completely sure.
May 28, 10:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But I know I want this with you. Whenever you're feeling ready.
May 28, 10:02 AM - Manika: Even I want it with you....when it happens it will be very special.
May 28, 10:02 AM - Manika: I love you Sonal.
May 28, 10:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm only afraid that we don't have much time with each other at least for the immediate future :/
May 28, 10:04 AM - Manika: Ahhh
May 28, 10:04 AM - Manika: We will make it work .
May 28, 10:04 AM - Manika: Tell me what you're thinking now ?
May 28, 10:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm thinking of you. About how I wish it was easier to be with you.
May 28, 10:05 AM - Manika: Nothing has changed between us no.
May 28, 10:06 AM - Manika: üòò
May 28, 10:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: No Mans. üòò
May 28, 10:06 AM - Manika: This should have been easier.
May 28, 10:07 AM - Manika: We can still share a room in goa
May 28, 10:07 AM - Sonal Saldanha: üòâ
May 28, 10:07 AM - Manika: I want to be with you.

May 28, 10:08 AM - Manika: I've told you what I want and all
May 28, 10:08 AM - Manika: It's not you its me üòÉ
May 28, 10:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: üôà
May 28, 10:09 AM - Manika: Perfect.
May 28, 10:09 AM - Manika: Are you a little upset ?

May 28, 10:20 AM - Manika: Tell me what feel about it
May 28, 10:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Hi Mans
May 28, 10:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Hold on, my brother's here.
May 28, 10:21 AM - Manika: Okay.
May 28, 10:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay so when we started off, there was no expectations.
May 28, 10:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I didn't say I like you with a plan in mind. I didn't think we'd even get half as close as this.
May 28, 10:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But then it happened. So everything that's happened since is more like a bonus than anything else.
May 28, 10:24 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm happy enough if we don't actually sleep with each other. Because it has to be a voluntary and mutual feeling.
May 28, 10:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But if we do end up in that place. I'm even happier. Because being with you makes me happy. And this is the most special thing two people can do.
May 28, 10:27 AM - Manika: You've been the best part of my life and it's been so amazing with you. You know I want it to happen between us,it's what I want also. But right now I am not sure. Il tell you when I am ready.
May 28, 10:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Of course üòò
May 28, 10:29 AM - Manika: I feel bad now.

May 28, 10:30 AM - Manika: Okay

May 28, 10:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: üòù
May 28, 10:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mans, should I be prepared? Do you want me to be?
May 28, 10:35 AM - Manika: If you're prepared I think it will be very tempting....so don't be.
May 28, 10:35 AM - Manika: Makes sense ?
May 28, 10:35 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Mmm
May 28, 10:35 AM - Manika: What do you think ?

May 31, 12:49 AM - Sonal Saldanha: The world is a place full of temptations. At every step and every turn there are things, inanimate things, that will try to own you. That will try to take control of you. The part we are unaware of is that these things that we speak of speak to us through those around us; our friends, peers, colleagues, and even parents! The scariest part is most of us who live life, live it in a walking daze. Believing and submitting to everything around us, allowing others and their opinions to shape our reality. Including out reality of how these things would change others' perception of who we are. It's no secret that in today's day everyone is after social validation. Everyone is constantly pinging those around them seeking their approval and looking for signposts that tell them how they can behave at any given time. But we, as humans, are credited with intellect. And the way we behave these days makes it seem like a false claim. You don't have to be someone else. You don't even have to be yourself. Be nobody. Because when you're nobody everything around you becomes irrelevant. You cease to ping those around you, you cease to be rooted to situations and circumstances, you become centred in yourself and your reality. That's when you become you. I know this is a bit of a lecture but I suppose if you read deeply enough into it it can help many of you who are having trouble grounding yourselves. Stop looking for validation. Stop looking at others to dictate your personality. Stop doing. Just be. üòä Have a great weekend.

May 31, 7:15 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Depends on how long that is for

Jun 3, 1:19 PM - Manika: I got for spring 2016 cmu but Silicon Valley campus
Jun 3, 1:23 PM - Manika: Is it good ?
Jun 3, 1:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Noo
Jun 3, 1:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Take uw
Jun 3, 1:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: More established.
Jun 3, 1:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: First of all CMU charges nonsensical fees. On top of that, silicon valley.
Jun 3, 1:45 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you were here till 2016, that'd be beyond awesome. But that'd be selfish on my part Mans.
Jun 3, 1:59 PM - Manika: So it's not good no.
Jun 3, 1:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's brand new, so I really can't say.
Jun 3, 2:00 PM - Manika: Uw is better ?
Jun 3, 2:01 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I think it's better.
Jun 3, 2:02 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I can check though.
Jun 3, 2:03 PM - Manika: They should have given Pittsburgh campus Atleast for spring.
Jun 3, 2:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: How good is the Masters in ECE in CMU Silicon Valley compared to the one in CMU Pittsburgh? - Quora - http://www.quora.com/How-good-is-the-Masters-in-ECE-in-CMU-Silicon-Valley-compared-to-the-one-in-CMU-Pittsburgh
Jun 3, 2:04 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Apparently the degree comes from Pittsburgh.
Jun 3, 2:07 PM - Manika: Yeah I read that.
Jun 3, 2:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Read the suggested questions at the bottom.
Jun 3, 2:07 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Doesn't sound bad at all.
Jun 3, 2:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And job opportunities should be amazing. Also, the weather much more suited to what you're comfortable with.
Jun 3, 2:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Places like CMU, you don't expect them to be sloppy. So it could be worth it. How much time do you have to decide?
Jun 3, 2:15 PM - Manika: They haven't mentioned any last date to decide.
Jun 3, 2:15 PM - Manika: So mostly I have Atleast 5 days to decide no.
Jun 3, 2:16 PM - Manika: So confusing now.
Jun 3, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Probably more actually. Because there's no immediate rush for visa and stuff.
Jun 3, 2:16 PM - Manika: I'll ask my cousins also.
Jun 3, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What I'm thinking is, the focus on hardcore research won't be as much at CMU.
Jun 3, 2:16 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what the descriptions on quora sound like.
Jun 3, 2:17 PM - Manika: But if it's for Uw then I have do the visa process now.
Jun 3, 2:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But that's not such a bad thing. Because you're not interested in a PhD anyway.
Jun 3, 2:17 PM - Manika: It's good for software engineering.
Jun 3, 2:17 PM - Manika: What I want to do a PhD later on ?
Jun 3, 2:17 PM - Manika: For now I need a job.
Jun 3, 2:17 PM - Manika: 2 years Atleast.
Jun 3, 2:17 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you wanted to do a PhD you'd know already.
Jun 3, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's a totally different mindset.
Jun 3, 2:18 PM - Manika: Ahhh yeah.
Jun 3, 2:18 PM - Manika: What to do now ?
Jun 3, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, the PhD isn't worth doing if you're thinking about money.
Jun 3, 2:18 PM - Manika: Il ask around and I'll decide in a few days. üòì
Jun 3, 2:18 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's five years of solo research.
Jun 3, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: After which you find a teaching position.
Jun 3, 2:19 PM - Manika: And that too they've given me spring.
Jun 3, 2:19 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What's the problem with spring? That's not so bad.
Jun 3, 2:21 PM - Manika: Oyee I think what they are offering is a one year course.
Jun 3, 2:21 PM - Manika: Stupid people!!
Jun 3, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: One year MS?
Jun 3, 2:22 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Show me?
Jun 3, 2:23 PM - Manika: I sent you the mail.

Jun 3, 2:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Professional MS
Jun 3, 2:27 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It's not the standard ms
Jun 3, 2:30 PM - Manika: Yes üòî
Jun 3, 2:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: What does UW cost?
Jun 3, 2:33 PM - Manika: 50000
Jun 3, 2:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Annually?
Jun 3, 2:33 PM - Manika: That's what they have said in the I-20
Jun 3, 2:33 PM - Manika: Fees is around 30,000 dollars.
Jun 3, 2:34 PM - Manika: Yes.
Jun 3, 2:34 PM - Manika: Annually.
Jun 3, 2:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The other 20 will be livinf then?
Jun 3, 2:34 PM - Manika: Health insurance and all
Jun 3, 2:34 PM - Manika: Plus living
Jun 3, 2:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Oh
Jun 3, 2:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: :/ Mindboggling
Jun 3, 2:35 PM - Manika: But professional Ms is not the proper Ms no
Jun 3, 2:36 PM - Manika: It won't help me that much nah
Jun 3, 2:36 PM - Manika: ?
Jun 3, 2:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm looking at their site now
Jun 3, 2:37 PM - Manika: You're always helping me üòò
Jun 3, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/research/current-groups.html
Jun 3, 2:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: This is all they have in terms of research groups.
Jun 3, 2:45 PM - Manika: It's just wireless communications and software engineering.
Jun 3, 2:47 PM - Sonal Saldanha: http://www.ece.cmu.edu/courses/rollout.pdf
Jun 3, 2:48 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The courses in green are offered at Silicon Valley Campus.
Jun 3, 2:50 PM - Manika: Ahhh
Jun 3, 2:50 PM - Manika: It's hardly anything no.
Jun 3, 2:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: There's a clear focus in terms of what they're offering.
Jun 3, 2:51 PM - Sonal Saldanha: If you don't find what you're looking for in here, no point accepting.
Jun 3, 2:51 PM - Manika: For software engineering its good.
Jun 3, 2:52 PM - Manika: I'm fine with computer architecture also.
Jun 3, 2:52 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. They started with the courses that they felt will make most sense to the people in the area.
Jun 3, 2:52 PM - Manika: Hmmm
Jun 3, 2:53 PM - Manika: Networking is also offered no.
Jun 3, 2:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Don't worry too much. If it doesn't have what you're looking for, you have UWash. And that place is amazing.
Jun 3, 2:53 PM - Manika: Job opportunities are better
Jun 3, 2:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You don't have to change your mind to settle for those courses
Jun 3, 2:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're at home now?
Jun 3, 2:54 PM - Manika: At the office
Jun 3, 2:54 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh.
Jun 3, 2:55 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Ask your cousins that are working there. You get the ground reality that way.
Jun 3, 2:57 PM - Manika: I've sent them also the mail.
Jun 3, 2:59 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Mans, I think its picture time.

Jun 4, 10:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You know how to breathe also?
Jun 4, 10:32 PM - Manika: Hmm breathe in and breath outüëÉ
Jun 4, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Whenever you're doing the exercise you should tighten the muscle you're trying to work.
Jun 4, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòë
Jun 4, 10:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: OMG.
Jun 4, 10:32 PM - Manika: Oh okay.
Jun 4, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, always tighten your stomach. And be straight. For all exercises.
Jun 4, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Except those where you have to bend.
Jun 4, 10:33 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The trick is, breathe out when you're doing work. Breathe in when you're getting back to a relaxed position.
Jun 4, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So crunches, breathe out when you come up. And breathe in when you go down.
Jun 4, 10:34 PM - Manika: Ahhh so that's the trick!
Jun 4, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: It helps you generate power also.
Jun 4, 10:34 PM - Manika: Crunches I know.
Jun 4, 10:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Yes. That and the tightening of the muscles.
Jun 4, 10:35 PM - Manika: How many do you do everyday?
Jun 4, 10:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Also, do every exercise very slowly. So you can really feel yourself working.
Jun 4, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Squats and lunges shape your legs and butt. There's this leg lifts thing I do for calves.
Jun 4, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Upper body, you need to build strength with push-ups before doing harder stuff.
Jun 4, 10:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: And crunches obviously help the core.
Jun 4, 10:40 PM - Manika: Already for half an hour.
Jun 4, 10:40 PM - Manika: I have to start !!

Jun 4, 11:39 PM - Manika: Yup.
Jun 4, 11:39 PM - Manika: Not sleepy

Jun 4, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. I used to want to be alone with you all the time.
Jun 4, 11:44 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's how it starts no?
Jun 4, 11:45 PM - Manika: Yeah I guess üòÉ
Jun 4, 11:45 PM - Manika: Even I wanted to hang out with you most of the time.

Jun 4, 11:48 PM - Manika: No connection at all
Jun 4, 11:49 PM - Sonal Saldanha: P-p-pussy power, pay me by the hour

If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours

Jun 5, 12:00 AM - Manika: How did it feel ?
Jun 5, 12:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I want to bite into it!
Jun 5, 12:01 AM - Manika: Bite my stomach...it's so flat you won't be able to bite üòú
Jun 5, 12:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I know right?! :P
Jun 5, 12:02 AM - Manika: I can bite yours no!

Jun 5, 12:05 AM - Manika: üëÄ
Jun 5, 12:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Yeah. You can't match me.
Jun 5, 12:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Too intense for you.
Jun 5, 12:05 AM - Manika: Hahaha yes
Jun 5, 12:05 AM - Manika: Too much passion ‚ô•Ô∏è
Jun 5, 12:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What if praby asked you the same question again?
Jun 5, 12:08 AM - Manika: I'd say I like him too much to let go of him. It would be difficult,so it all depends on him now .
Jun 5, 12:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahhh :*
Jun 5, 12:08 AM - Manika: I'd say that you are very important to me!
Jun 5, 12:09 AM - Manika: What would you say?
Jun 5, 12:09 AM - Manika: Honest answer !
Jun 5, 12:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What exactly is the question?
Jun 5, 12:11 AM - Manika: What about you and manika ?
Jun 5, 12:12 AM - Manika: What happens after college is over ?
Jun 5, 12:12 AM - Manika: That was what she had asked me.
Jun 5, 12:13 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'd say college has been over for over three weeks now and that hasn't stopped us one bit. Even being 250km away doesn't take away how good this feels. It's been way better than it would've been if college was on. I think that answers the question. No?
Jun 5, 12:14 AM - Sonal Saldanha: College has been over for almost a month now if you think of the internals as the end.
Jun 5, 12:15 AM - Manika: And we are going strong üë´
Jun 5, 12:16 AM - Manika: Do you think Bangalore  and Seattle will work out ?
Jun 5, 12:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't know. I don't think it will. I can't bear to not to be near you.
Jun 5, 12:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: A couple of days, a couple of weeks is tolerable.
Jun 5, 12:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: But longer will drive me crazy :(
Jun 5, 12:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It can always be done okay? But neither of us will be happy.
Jun 5, 12:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It'll be a digital relationship. Does that sound appealing to you?
Jun 5, 12:18 AM - Manika: Hmm yeah. Texting and skyping isn't the same as being with each other.
Jun 5, 12:19 AM - Manika: It would be like dating Siri.
Jun 5, 12:20 AM - Manika: No?
Jun 5, 12:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: "you're awesome siri!"
Jun 5, 12:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I remember when you said that
Jun 5, 12:20 AM - Sonal Saldanha: So cute you sounded :*
Jun 5, 12:22 AM - Manika: I'll be saying that to you on whatsapp!

Jun 5, 12:25 AM - Manika: Yes Siri didn't accept my proposal !
Jun 5, 12:25 AM - Manika: You were my second option!
Jun 5, 12:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's history :P
Jun 5, 12:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: As in, what you say to siri.
Jun 5, 12:26 AM - Manika: But my best option üòÉ
Jun 5, 12:26 AM - Manika: Feeling insecure?
Jun 5, 12:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's one day, something embarrassing happened when I took your phone :P
Jun 5, 12:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You can love anyone as long as you love me :D
Jun 5, 12:27 AM - Manika: What?
Jun 5, 12:27 AM - Manika: What embarrassing ?
Jun 5, 12:27 AM - Manika: I didn't get you again üôà
Jun 5, 12:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Prableen had sent you a message
Jun 5, 12:28 AM - Manika: What ?

Jun 5, 12:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We were sitting in Classroom Block, and you ran out when she called you. I asked you why you've to go and all, you couldn't think of any excuses :P

Jun 5, 10:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No, just in general. You forgive.
Jun 5, 10:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even when the whole Goa thing happened. You wanted to blame yourself. Then you were so quick to let it go with your parents.
Jun 5, 10:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's so unlike me! I would've kept a grudge and brought it up and sulked for a long long time.
Jun 5, 10:39 PM - Manika: I have been in these situations before and I know there's no use sulking and all. Doesn't help.
Jun 5, 10:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Hmm..
Jun 5, 10:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Sometimes I think about it, about what this week could've been. And it makes me feel really bad.

Jun 5, 11:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòò
Jun 5, 11:39 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But you know something? I don't want to think too seriously about us. Not yet at least. I don't want either of us to get hurt :(
Jun 5, 11:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Truth be told, I've been there before. Been in something very serious. But it was too early. Too young an age. Family issues, distance issues. Things became very difficult and fell apart.
Jun 5, 11:41 PM - Manika: Sometimes I feel you're better off with someone smarter than me. Like your friend Nagi types.
Jun 5, 11:42 PM - Sonal Saldanha: No Mans. You stop thinking that way. I like you. So I want to be with you.

Jun 9, 11:53 AM - Manika: I have my phone
Jun 9, 11:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Never got along with any of them. I'm so surprised when I see some families are so close

Jun 9, 12:02 PM - Manika: Out together will have atleast 25-30 people.

Jun 9, 12:08 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even my mom and her siblings. The fraser town aunt calls everyday.

Jun 9, 12:09 PM - Manika: It's nice to have siblings.
Jun 9, 12:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But my parents don't have other friends that they talk to or hang out with. Not really. Maybe one or two people. Or maybe neighbors, or work acquaintances.
Jun 9, 12:10 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't want it to be like that for me as well.
Jun 9, 12:11 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's what I keep telling them. I've told them that they don't have friends and that I don't want to end up like that! :P
Jun 9, 12:12 PM - Manika: Yeah but sometimes I forget to text people and keep in touch .
Jun 9, 12:12 PM - Manika: But I don't like to isolate myself. I need people around me all the time.
Jun 9, 12:12 PM - Manika: You have so many friends.
Jun 9, 12:12 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I need some people around me all the time. Others can come and go.
Jun 9, 12:13 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't really care too much. Like how aanch keeps complaining that I don't text first. We're close enough, but I don't need to talk to her everyday to get by and stuff.
Jun 9, 12:14 PM - Manika: Yeah that's there but I talk to everyday.
Jun 9, 12:15 PM - Manika: Even in the hostel I used to talk to everyone.
Jun 9, 12:15 PM - Manika: Everyone *

Jun 10, 8:48 AM - Manika: üòò
Jun 10, 8:48 AM - Sonal Saldanha: üòä
Jun 10, 8:49 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You used to be so scared to tell me anything at all like this no?
Jun 10, 8:50 AM - Manika: Yeah it was kinda new to me.

Jun 10, 8:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Finish off the coding.
Jun 10, 8:54 AM - Manika: No baby I don't think this is wrong.
Jun 10, 8:55 AM - Manika: This is how we feel about each other no.
Jun 10, 8:55 AM - Manika: Do your work today ‚ù§Ô∏è
Jun 10, 8:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Okay üòò
Jun 10, 8:55 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You're living next to the temple itself? In tirumala?
Jun 10, 8:55 AM - Manika: Yes.
Jun 10, 8:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Fancy.
Jun 10, 8:56 AM - Manika: Everyone has to stay here only.
Jun 10, 8:56 AM - Manika: Town is too far from the temple.
Jun 10, 8:56 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I thought people stay in the town and then walk up.
Jun 10, 8:57 AM - Manika: Yeah you can do that but it takes 2-3 hours to climb the hill
Jun 10, 8:57 AM - Manika: Should have the stamina to climb.
Jun 10, 8:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Ahh.
Jun 10, 8:58 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Being a Hindu devotee takes too much effort :P
Jun 10, 8:59 AM - Manika: But we aren't forced to do anything like the Muslims.
Jun 10, 8:59 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm just joking okay? Don't be offended üòò
Jun 10, 8:59 AM - Manika: Would you date a Muslim ?
Jun 10, 9:00 AM - Manika: I'm not offended üòÇ
Jun 10, 9:00 AM - Manika: My family is not very strict about rituals and all
Jun 10, 9:00 AM - Manika: Thank god üôè
Jun 10, 9:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: My family is quite strict.
Jun 10, 9:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Pray everyday, go to church once a week, attend catechism, go for confession.
Jun 10, 9:02 AM - Manika: I want to listen to your confessions!!
Jun 10, 9:02 AM - Sonal Saldanha: They do so much more. They do novenas, skip nonveg on some days, go for mass on first Fridays. Attend adorations.
Jun 10, 9:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: üòì
Jun 10, 9:03 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't confess. I keep skipping üòì
Jun 10, 9:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Muslim, I don't know.
Jun 10, 9:04 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Depends on how much the religion gets in the way. But that's true for everyone.
Jun 10, 9:05 AM - Manika: What's true?
Jun 10, 9:05 AM - Sonal Saldanha: As in, I don't like overly zealous people when it comes to religion
Jun 10, 9:05 AM - Manika: Go for confessions....try it once!
Jun 10, 9:06 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I've gone for confession.. But I don't feel like I need to. I don't feel burdened by anything that I know or I've done. I think that's what confession is for no? If you feel like you've made mistakes?
Jun 10, 9:07 AM - Manika: Do they advice you after that?
Jun 10, 9:07 AM - Manika: Will you be face to face with the priest while confessing.
Jun 10, 9:08 AM - Sonal Saldanha: They do. But it's sort of strange. The advice is not practical. It's from a religious position.
Jun 10, 9:09 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Usually there's supposed to be a veil between the priest and you, but sometimes there isn't. You sit next to them, but they don't look at you.
Jun 10, 9:09 AM - Manika: üòÇüòÇ
Jun 10, 9:10 AM - Manika: Sonal sweetheart üòç
Jun 10, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: ‚ò∫
Jun 10, 9:10 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What do you not like in people?
Jun 10, 9:15 AM - Manika: I usually don't like short tempered people.
Jun 10, 9:15 AM - Manika: Getting angry for each and everything.
Jun 10, 9:15 AM - Manika: And you ?
Jun 10, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I told you one. The extreme religious part.
Jun 10, 9:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I don't like people that take everything easy.
Jun 10, 9:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Finally I don't like people without any ambition.
Jun 10, 11:15 AM - Manika: What do you think I am like ?
Jun 10, 11:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You're not any of those things. No?
Jun 10, 11:35 AM - Manika: I am ambitious !
Jun 10, 11:35 AM - Manika: I may be a little ignorant at times.
Jun 10, 11:35 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Exactly. You are ambitious üòä
Jun 10, 11:36 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I wouldn't say ignorant.
Jun 10, 11:36 AM - Manika: But in lazy and I don't work hard .
Jun 10, 11:37 AM - Manika: What do you think of me since you know me for a while?
Jun 10, 12:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: So cool
Jun 10, 12:31 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Even I'm lazy :/
Jun 10, 12:32 PM - Sonal Saldanha: That's a fault that lies in me as well.
Jun 10, 12:34 PM - Manika: What were you typing?
Jun 10, 12:34 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Since I know so much about you, I feel like you're amazing given all that you've been through. But you let others make your choices and I'm trying to get you to be better. Different.
Jun 10, 12:35 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You have ideas and ambitions but you don't work too hard towards them. No? You take things lightly sometimes.
Jun 10, 12:36 PM - Manika: Yeah I don't work towards them.
Jun 10, 12:36 PM - Manika: You know me wellüòòüòò
Jun 10, 12:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But you know we're all like that.
Jun 10, 12:36 PM - Sonal Saldanha: The challenge is to be better.
Jun 10, 12:36 PM - Manika: Have to do better!
Jun 10, 12:37 PM - Manika: These two years we have to do really well!
Jun 10, 12:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: I know.
Jun 10, 12:37 PM - Sonal Saldanha: üòò
Jun 10, 12:38 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You're so scared sometimes. You shouldn't be. I want you to be strong so others look up to you.
Jun 10, 12:39 PM - Manika: I am kinda starting to make my own choices üòÉ
Jun 10, 12:40 PM - Manika: You've helped me üòò
Jun 10, 12:40 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Good girl :* you should always hear others' opinion but you should always make your own choices.
Jun 10, 12:41 PM - Manika: For a change you've called me good girl
Jun 10, 12:41 PM - Manika: Yay
Jun 10, 12:41 PM - Sonal Saldanha: But you're my bad girl. That's how I like you üòâ
Jun 10, 12:42 PM - Manika: You've spoilt me thoroughly
Jun 10, 12:43 PM - Manika: You're my good boy !
Jun 10, 12:43 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Thoroughly it seems üòÇ
I didn't do anything! üòá

Jun 11, 12:21 AM - Manika: I don't want you to be worried about us.
Jun 11, 12:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: It's more frustration than worry actually.
Jun 11, 12:22 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I actually worry about whether or not you make it to the US, the way things are :/ Everyone else is finishing their interviews or has a date already. Urs's date is already on July 7th or something!

Jun 11, 1:00 AM - Manika: We need to figure out what to do no
Jun 11, 1:01 AM - Manika: Trying to be with you is so hard cause there's no time and trying to stay away from you is also equally difficult.
Jun 11, 1:01 AM - Sonal Saldanha: There's plenty of time! Two months isn't enough?
Jun 11, 1:02 AM - Manika: But in a month I meet you only twice or thrice.

Jun 11, 1:17 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I wouldn't be having this conversation with you otherwise.
Jun 11, 1:18 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I just feel so helpless. Nothing I hope for works out..
Jun 11, 1:19 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I can be happy with whatever little time I get to spend with you, but deep down, it's not even close to enough. I want to spend my days with you!
Jun 11, 1:19 AM - Manika: Sonal don't be so negative. I'm just a small part of your life you have so much ahead of you.
Jun 11, 1:20 AM - Manika: I want spend more time with you. I'll try my best to get away from home to be with you.
Jun 11, 1:21 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If you think wanting this so much is being negative, then I don't know what to say to you :-/
Jun 11, 1:22 AM - Manika: No i didn't mean it that wAy
Jun 11, 1:22 AM - Manika: Now you're just misunderstanding me.
Jun 11, 1:22 AM - Manika: I want to be with you and I like you!!
Jun 11, 1:23 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Being with you makes me happy. I like being happy.
Jun 11, 1:25 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I'm sorry I make this so tough :/
Jun 11, 1:25 AM - Manika: I never thought what it's like to be away from you. Even though it makes me sad doesn't mean I stopped liking you.
Jun 11, 1:26 AM - Manika: I can't anything more than this....you tell me what to do.
Jun 11, 1:26 AM - Manika: I'll be fine with whatever you decide.
Jun 11, 1:26 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Did I tell you I want to stop doing this at any point?
Jun 11, 1:26 AM - Manika: Think *
Jun 11, 1:27 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's not what I want :-/ Even I can't stop liking you just because your situation at home doesn't let me be wtih you.
Jun 11, 1:28 AM - Sonal Saldanha: That's why I said I feel helpless. Helpless because I make it easier for you to get away from home. Helpless because I can't do without you anymore.
Jun 11, 1:30 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Lets just keep going and hope it gets better.
Jun 11, 1:30 AM - Manika: Sonal I wish all this family matter disappear and I could be with you all the time.
Jun 11, 1:31 AM - Sonal Saldanha: We're so close but I don't even know what its like to hold on to you for two minutes!

Jun 11, 9:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Hi
Jun 11, 9:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: I actually like the sound of this. The focus is on courses and on employment. And they help you settle right into silicon valley.
Jun 11, 10:33 AM - Manika: And I get a MS degree in the end
Jun 11, 10:33 AM - Manika: It won't be mentioned as professional Ms degree
Jun 11, 10:33 AM - Sonal Saldanha: You know what?
Jun 11, 10:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: If I had to assess you without bias, I think you're not suited for a research program.
Jun 11, 10:34 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Especially because it's independent research.
Jun 11, 10:35 AM - Manika: Hmmm
Jun 11, 10:36 AM - Manika: If I actually make up my mind I can do research I guess
Jun 11, 10:37 AM - Manika: I'm sacred of not getting employed .
Jun 11, 10:37 AM - Manika: But since it's in Silicon Valley it's better no.
Jun 11, 10:39 AM - Sonal Saldanha: Employment opportunities don't depend so much on location I've heard. But living in Silicon Valley helps you travel to SF and the surrounding areas for meetings and to make connections.
Jun 11, 10:42 AM - Manika: Ahhhh
Jun 11, 10:53 AM - Sonal Saldanha: What're you plans for today?

Jun 11, 12:29 PM - Sonal Saldanha: You get to decide what you're doing with your time.

Jun 11, 1:52 PM - Manika: I am not helpless...but everytime I make plans with you something or the other comes up
Jun 11, 1:53 PM - Sonal Saldanha: Isn't that what is called being helpless? You can't move anything else.
Jun 11, 1:58 PM - Manika: I think I have you too much hopes
